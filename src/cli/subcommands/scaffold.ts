/**
 * `factory scaffold` — prepare a target repo to be run by the factory (WS3 / Δ A).
 *
 *   factory scaffold [--repo <owner/name>] [--provision]

 * `--repo` is OPTIONAL (Prompt G / F-repo): auto-derived from the `origin` remote
 * when omitted (the CLI is always cwd-rooted in the target repo).
 *
 * Idempotently copies the per-repo COMMITTED artifacts the new design consumes —

 * (`.stryker.config.json` mutation, `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` arch, `eslint.config.mjs`
 * lint baseline) the GateRunner runs in the target worktree — plus a `.gitignore`
 * guard, then PROBES branch protection on `develop` (the integration base):
 * refuse-to-run when it is missing (#2 / Δ A), unless `--provision` is opted in to
 * write it. Per-run staging branches (`staging-<run-id>`) are minted at `run create`
 * — scaffold no longer creates or protects a shared `staging` branch.
 *
 * Run/spec STATE is never written here (it lives outside the repo under the data

const HELP = `factory scaffold — prepare a repo for Factory v2

Usage:
  factory scaffold [--repo <owner/name>] [--provision] [--waive mutation|coverage] [--force-managed]

Writes the committed gate contract and CI workflows for git.baseBranch (default:
develop). Requires stable strict branch protection with the configured required
checks. --provision creates or strengthens protection; it never downgrades it.
Runs do not change protection. One PRD produces one feature branch and one PR.

Options:
  --repo <owner/name>   Defaults to origin; a mismatch refuses.
  --provision          Create or strengthen strict protection (external write).
  --waive mutation     Explicitly waive mutation in a new gate contract.
  --waive coverage     Explicitly waive coverage in a new gate contract.
  --force-managed      Re-adopt customized managed files. Never deletes a
                       customized stale workflow.

Commit .factory/gates.json, .factory/scaffold.lock and generated workflows before
creating a run. Existing valid contracts and customized seed configs are preserved.
Pristine managed files update automatically; customized managed files refuse before
writes unless --force-managed is supplied. Playwright seeds require a declared
@playwright/test dependency; scaffold does not install it.
Build environment comes from quality.gateEnv.`
/**
 * The `.gitignore` lines scaffold guarantees. Two invariants drive the list:
 *
 *   - The TRACKED/IGNORED split inside `.claude/` is made EXPLICIT — each ignored
 *     `.claude/` child (per-machine local state) is enumerated individually so the
 *     guarantee never relies on a wildcard, a global `core.excludesfile`, or Claude
 *     Code's own gitignore management. Crucially `.claude/` is NOT ignored wholesale
 *     and `.claude/settings.json` is NOT listed, so the factory-emitted
 *     `.claude/settings.json` stays TRACKED while `.claude/settings.local.json`
 *     (per-machine overrides) is IGNORED.
 *   - Factory + worktree state (`.claude-plugin-data/`, `*.worktree`) must never be
 *     committed.
 *
 * NOTE: `docs/factory/**` (the generated spec.md + tasks.json a run mirrors into the
 * repo) is deliberately NOT ignored — it is tracked as durable, PR-reviewable
 * provenance of the spec that drove each merged PR.
