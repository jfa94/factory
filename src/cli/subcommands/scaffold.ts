const HELP = `factory scaffold — prepare a repo for the factory pipeline

Usage:
  factory scaffold [--repo <owner/name>] [--provision] [--waive mutation|coverage]

Copies the committed CI + gate-config templates and probes branch protection on
develop (the integration base). Without --provision a repo whose develop branch is
not protected (strict up-to-date + required checks) causes scaffold to REFUSE loudly.
Per-run staging branches are minted at run create — scaffold no longer touches them.
The managed quality-gate.yml is rendered with the configured quality.gateEnv
(set via 'factory configure --set quality.gateEnv.<KEY>=<value>').

Options:
  --repo <owner/name>   OPTIONAL. Target GitHub repo (used for the protection probe).
                        Auto-derived from the 'origin' remote when omitted; an
                        explicit value disagreeing with the remote fails loud.
  --provision           Write branch protection if missing (default: refuse)
  --waive mutation      Record the mutation gate as deliberately waived in the gate
                        contract instead of refusing when stryker is not installed
  --waive coverage      Record the coverage gate as deliberately waived instead of
                        refusing when no vitest coverage provider is installed

Also resolves + writes the GATE CONTRACT (.factory/gates.json, Decision 46): the
committed per-gate applicability agreement. Refuses below the floor (test + type +
build equivalents must be contractable). COMMIT the file — 'factory run' requires
it tracked. The contract is seed-like: an existing valid gates.json is never
touched — delete it and re-scaffold to pick up new resolution rules (e.g. the
S8 coverage flip).

Re-scaffold refreshes OUTDATED files: managed files (the CI net) on any drift, and
seed configs ONLY while pristine — untouched since scaffold wrote them, per the
committed .factory/scaffold.lock hash record. A customized seed is project-owned
and never overwritten; delete it and re-scaffold to re-adopt the latest baseline.`

/**
 * The `.gitignore` lines scaffold guarantees. Two invariants drive the list:
 *
 *   - The TRACKED/IGNORED split inside `.claude/` is made EXPLICIT — each ignored
 *     `.claude/` child (per-machine local state) is enumerated individually so the
 *     guarantee never relies on a wildcard, a global `core.excludesfile`, or Claude
 *     Code's own gitignore management. Crucially `.claude/` is NOT ignored wholesale
 *     and `.claude/settings.json` is NOT listed, so the factory-emitted
 *     `.claude/settings.json` stays TRACKED while `.claude/settings.local.json`
 *     (per-machine overrides) is IGNORED.
 *   - Factory + worktree state (`.claude-plugin-data/`, `*.worktree`) must never be
 *     committed.
 *
 * NOTE: `docs/factory/**` (the generated spec.md + tasks.json a run mirrors into the
 * repo) is deliberately NOT ignored — it is tracked as durable, PR-reviewable
 * provenance of the spec that drove each merged PR.
