/**
 * E1 (F-perm) — TARGET-repo `.claude/settings.json` + `.claude/settings.local.json`
 * emit + idempotent merge (Decision 17, corrected).
 *
 * `factory scaffold` calls {@link ensureTargetSettings} so an interactive
 * `/factory:run` in the scaffolded repo runs the CLI + agents WITHOUT a
 * permission prompt per call. It writes (or non-destructively MERGES into) TWO
 * files, split by what is safe to commit:
 *   - `.claude/settings.json` (COMMITTED): unions {@link FACTORY_TARGET_BASE_ALLOWLIST}
 *     + the baked, TILDE-form data-dir allow globs (from {@link buildTargetDataDirRules})
 *     into `permissions.allow`, and forces `worktree.baseRef: "head"` (the
 *     staging-determinism invariant — CLAUDE.md "Worktree base invariant",
 *     Decision 12). Carries NO `additionalDirectories` — see below.
 *   - `.claude/settings.local.json` (GITIGNORED, per-machine): the factory-managed
 *     `permissions.additionalDirectories` entry, ALWAYS ABSOLUTE. Claude Code does
 *     not expand `~/` there (verified live: the tilde form left the
 *     working-directory-boundary prompt firing on task-worktree writes,
 *     run-20260630-095544), so this entry necessarily leaks `$HOME`/username and
 *     is wrong on any other machine/CI — it must never land in the committed file.
 * Both merges leave every other user key — including the user's OWN `statusLine`
 * — untouched.
 *
 * Why NO statusLine here (deliberate trade-off): the target repo's
 * `.claude/settings.json` is the user's interactive settings for that repo.
 * Injecting `statusLine` would clobber their own statusline. The factory
 * statusline (usage-cache pacing) belongs ONLY in the separate E2
 * merged-settings.json relaunch (`factory autonomy ensure`), never here.
 *
 * Why this allow-list and not autonomous-mode's coarse `Bash(*)`: this is an
 * INTERACTIVE session with a human present (Decision 17 "Scope"). We grant the
 * concrete command families the pipeline genuinely invokes — the `factory` CLI,
 * git/gh plumbing, the agent tools, and the data-dir reads/writes — and nothing
 * wider. The autonomous-mode deny-list / `Bash(*)` is intentionally NOT mirrored
 * here; a human approves anything the pipeline didn't anticipate.
