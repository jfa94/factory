/**
 * WS9/WS10 — Stop hook: the stop pass-through + resumability hint.
 *
 * The hook NO LONGER blocks a premature stop. A live run with pending work used to
 * emit `{decision:"block"}` to force the in-session runner to keep driving —
 * the "session-hostage" behaviour that trapped a session which could not progress.
 * That arm (and its `FACTORY_ALLOW_STOP` escape hatch) is removed: a session may
 * always stop, and a run left `running` with pending work stays cleanly resumable via
 * `factory resume`. Re-entry is idempotent even when the stop landed mid-spawn: the
 * orchestrator records a `spawn_in_flight` checkpoint at every spawn emit, so a resume that
 * re-enters the same (phase, rung) before results were recorded resets the task worktree to
 * the captured pre-spawn tip — discarding the abandoned producer's partial work — before
 * re-spawning (see `orchestrator.ts` spawn-agents case + `applyResume`).
 *
 * The hook also NO LONGER finalizes on stop. The old arm called `manager.finalize` —
 * a pure status flip — bypassing the real `finalizeRun` delivery pipeline (rollup PR,
 * PRD close/failure comment, report.md, the e2e-failed→failed override). Once flipped,
 * every recovery surface read the violated state as healthy: `nextTask` returns `done`
 * for a terminal run so resume never re-enters finalize, and rescue's rollup detector
 * requires a `run.rollup` that finalizeRun never wrote. Now an owned, session-mode run
 * whose tasks are ALL terminal is simply LEFT `running` (with a log hint): the next
 * `factory resume` re-derives all-terminal and routes through the real `finalizeRun`.
 * The hook performs NO state mutation at all.
 *
 * SESSION-SCOPED (Prompt J — so the hint names the RIGHT run, and only this
 * session's own): debug runs pass through silently (the debug driver owns
 * finalize between review⇄fix passes), as do runs owned by a DIFFERENT session.
 *
 * The ONLY remaining block is an inaccessible data directory (M9 — surface the
 * inconsistency, never silently accept a corrupt-state stop). A foreign run's
 * unreadable state.json never surfaces here (listRuns skips unreadable runs silently).
 *
 * Output contract (Stop hook): a block (corruption only) is `{decision:"block",reason}`
 * on STDOUT with exit 0 (the JSON is the block signal). Allow = no output, exit 0.
