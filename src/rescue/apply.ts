/**
 * WS12 — rescue APPLY (the writer the SCAN feeds; Decision 22, Δ S).
 *
 * `scanRun` (scan.ts) classifies a stalled run; `applyRescue` is the only mutation
 * that acts on that classification. It resets the resettable tasks back to `pending`
 * (clearing the stale producer/reviewer/failure state) and, if the run had already
 * finalized to a terminal status, REOPENS it to `running` so the orchestrator picks the
 * reset work back up. After apply, a plain `factory run resume` (quota gate) +
 * re-drive carries the run forward — rescue is the missing seam between them.
 *
 * THE "without repeating dead ends" CONTRACT (WS12 acceptance), enforced here:
 *   - DEFAULT apply resets `scan.resettable` = stuck (crashed in-flight) ∪
 *     recoverable (`failed` + `blocked-environmental`, blocker may have cleared).
 *   - DEAD-END failures (`spec-defect` / `capability-budget`) are LEFT failed — a
 *     re-attempt just repeats a determined failure. They reset ONLY when a human
 *     asserts the root cause is fixed, via `includeDeadEnds` (the CLI
 *     `--include-dead-ends` flag).
 *   - A `done` task is NEVER reset — that would un-ship merged work; an explicit
 *     `--task <done-id>` is a LOUD error, not a silent skip.
 *
 * Pure-ish: the only side effect is one locked `StateManager.update`. All
 * classification logic is delegated to the pure {@link scanRun}; the actual reset
 * is computed INSIDE the update mutator (on the locked snapshot) so a concurrent
 * writer cannot race the scan against the write.

 * Clear a `failed` e2e_phase verdict so `wantsE2e` (orchestrator/next.ts) re-enters
 * the phase and the verdict re-derives on the next pass — the Decision 39 rescue
 * repair path for W4.
 *
 * A failure with an EMPTY manifest is unambiguously a PRE-authoring failure (the
 * author crashed/timed out, emitted an unparseable status, or listed an unsafe
 * `spec_path` — every one of `runE2eRecord`'s `markFailed` calls before a manifest
 * is persisted). `runSuiteAndDecide` (the only other `markFailed` caller) always
 * reads a persisted, non-empty manifest first (its own empty-manifest branch is a
 * `markDone`, never a failure) — so no POST-authoring failure ever has an empty
 * manifest. That makes `manifest.length === 0` a reliable signal here: return
 * `undefined` (phase absent) so `runE2eEmit`'s `run.e2e_phase === undefined` gate
 * re-fires and the author actually re-spawns, instead of leaving a defined,
 * empty-manifest phase that `runSuiteAndDecide` would silently `markDone`
 * (Decision 39's "re-enters and re-derives" contract falsified for exactly this case).
 *
 * Otherwise (a manifest was authored), the triage rule is: DROP live cursors and
 * concluded verdicts (`status`/`reason`/`advisory`/`ended_at`/`adjudication` — a
 * rescued run's adjudication worktree is dead, and a stale cursor would re-spawn
 * against it); PRESERVE history and caps (`manifest`/`reopen_counts`/`attempts`/
 * `adjudication_counts` — the authored suite + per-task/per-spec cap spend a fresh
 * pass still needs). The author is not re-invoked once it has produced a manifest;
 * a dropped adjudication cursor is re-derived by the next suite pass.
 *
 * Lives here (not in orchestrator/e2e.ts, its only other natural home) to avoid a
 * circular import: e2e.ts already imports `resetTaskRow` from this module via
 * orchestrator/deps.ts → rescue/index.ts → rescue/apply.ts.
