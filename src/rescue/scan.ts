/**
 * WS12 — rescue SCAN (the read-only diagnostic; Decision 22, Δ S).
 *
 * A run can stop in a shape `factory resume` cannot untangle: a crashed or
 * suspended session left tasks STUCK mid-phase (status `executing`/`reviewing`/
 * `shipping`) with no determination ever reached. The orchestrator has no handler for a
 * stuck in-flight task — the run-level orchestrator (`nextTask`) THROWS "dependency cycle or deadlock" the moment
 * no task is actionable (no ready/cascade-failable `pending` task) yet non-terminal
 * work remains. Resume never touches task state (it only clears the quota gate), so
 * resume alone cannot recover such a run.
 *
 * Rescue fills exactly that gap. `scanRun` is the PURE, read-only survey: it
 * classifies every task by what rescue can do with it and reports whether a re-drive
 * would deadlock — the input the runner (and, for ambiguous failures, the
 * rescue-diagnostic agent) reasons over before calling `rescue apply`.
 *
 * "Without repeating dead ends" (the WS12 acceptance) is encoded in the disposition:
 *   - `failed` + `blocked-environmental` → RECOVERABLE: the blocker (a flaky env, a
 *     dependency that has since been reset) may have cleared, so a default rescue
 *     re-attempts it (Decision: "prefer recovery over abandonment");
 *   - `failed` + `spec-defect` / `capability-budget` → DEAD-END: re-running repeats a
 *     determined failure, so a default rescue LEAVES it failed. It is reset only when
 *     a human explicitly asserts the root cause is fixed (`apply --include-dead-ends`).
 *
 * SCOPE: this module stays PURE over {@link RunState} (trivially testable). GitHub-side
 * drift (a PR merged but not recorded, a closed-unmerged PR, a landed auto-armed rollup)
 * is DETECTED by the sibling reconcile module (`src/rescue/reconcile.ts`, P1): the scan
 * CLI embeds its report under the envelope's `github` key and `factory reconcile`
 * emits it standalone. Forward-only drift REPAIR is the sibling adopt module
 * (`src/rescue/adopt.ts`, Decision 60) that `reconcile --adopt` / `rescue apply` drive;
 * only LOCAL-git residue needing judgment stays rescue-reconciler territory.
