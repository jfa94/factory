/**
 * P1b — GitHub ADOPTION (forward-only autonomous repair; Decision 60, Session 5).
 *
 * Session 4's {@link reconcileRun} gave the engine read-only GitHub truth but every
 * remedy stayed a manual sentence. This module is the write side: it turns the
 * forward-only, non-destructive drift classes into applied repairs —
 *   - merged-unrecorded → flip the task to `done` (adopt the merged PR as its ship),
 *   - stale-pr-number   → rebind to the head's sole OPEN PR, or clear the pointer,
 *   - branch-missing     → re-push the local branch (plain push, never `--force`),
 *   - rollup-landed / all-tasks-merged → reopen a terminal run so finalize completes.
 * Destructive divergence (closed-unmerged, staging-missing, an ambiguous head, a
 * base mismatch) is NEVER touched — it flows out as `surfaced` for a human to decide.
 *
 * The hazard this closes: a merged-unrecorded task classifies as `resettable`, so a
 * default `rescue apply`/`auto` would reset it to `pending` and clobber merged work.
 * Adopting it to `done` FIRST — on the same locked snapshot the reset selection reads —
 * makes it un-resettable. Adoptions are FREE: they never spend `self_heal.attempts`
 * and never append a `human_touches` entry (D49) — only real task resets do.
 *
 * Split so `reconcile --adopt` can reuse an already-computed report without a second
 * probe: {@link planAdoptions} is pure (RunState + ReconcileReport → plan),
 * {@link applyAdoptions} is the single-lock executor, {@link adoptFromReport} chains
 * them, and {@link adoptRun} adds the reconcile probe (throws on any gh failure —
 * all-or-nothing, so each call site applies its own outage policy).
