/**
 * WS12 — the deterministic partial-run report (Decision 22, Δ S).
 *
 * "Never ship silently." When a run finalizes to `completed` or `failed`
 * (Decision 34: develop receives only complete PRDs), this module turns the
 * persisted {@link RunState} + the durable {@link SpecManifest} into a precise,
 * deterministic account of WHAT shipped and WHAT failed and WHY — the source of
 * truth for the PRD failure comment (Decision 36) and the rollup PR body. It is also
 * useful mid-flight (a `suspended`/`paused` run) to describe which tasks are still
 * incomplete.
 *
 * PURE + DERIVE-DON'T-STORE: the report is computed afresh from ground truth
 * (task status + the spec's acceptance criteria) every time. Nothing here is read
 * back from a stored "report" blob. The builder takes an explicit `now` so a test
 * pins `generated_at` deterministically.
 *
 * Honesty over guesswork: a `failed` task never cleared the merge gate, so it
 * met NONE of its acceptance criteria. The report lists the task's FULL acceptance
 * criteria as `unmet_criteria` rather than fabricating per-criterion satisfaction
 * the runtime never recorded.
