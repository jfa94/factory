/**
 * WS3 — SERIAL WRITER #1 (Δ L, §9.2).
 *
 * Merges into `staging` are serialized in EVERY mode: task PRs land ONE at a
 * time. The mechanism is an app-level merge LOCK (proper-lockfile, the SAME lock
 * primitive WS1's StateManager uses) on a data-dir merge-lock file, plus
 * required-branches-up-to-date enforcement (which works on ANY GitHub plan):
 *
 *   acquire lock
 *     -> verify the PR is mergeable AND its head is up-to-date with staging
 *     -> if BEHIND: refuse/yield (no force-push, no rebase-publish — global rule)
 *     -> `gh pr merge --squash` (NOT N concurrent `--auto`)
 *   release lock
 *
 * Probe-detected upgrade: if mergeQueueProbe() reports native GitHub merge-queue,
 * enqueue via `--auto` and let GitHub serialize instead (still one logical
 * serializer; never N concurrent app-level merges). merge-queue-as-default is v2.
 *
 * The app-level lock NEVER arms N concurrent `--auto`: two concurrent merge()
 * calls observe strictly non-overlapping critical sections.
