/**
 * Report → spec adapter for `/factory:debug` (Decision 39 rebuild, Task 3).
 *
 * The existing spec pipeline (`resolveSpec`/`gateSpec`/`storeSpec` in
 * `src/cli/subcommands/spec.ts`) fetches a PRD via an injectable {@link GhClient}
 * keyed by a positive-integer "issue number," then runs the SAME
 * spec-generator ⇄ spec-reviewer loop regardless of where the PRD came from.
 * `/factory:debug` feeds that unchanged loop a SYNTHETIC "PRD" rendered from a
 * whole-scope review report (`AdjudicateWholeScopeResult.confirmedBlockers`,
 * `src/debug/review.ts`) instead of a real GitHub issue.
 *
 * This module owns exactly three things, and nothing else:
 *   1. {@link debugIssueNumber} — a synthetic issue-number scheme
 *      (`DEBUG_ISSUE_BASE + passNumber`) that can never collide with a real
 *      GitHub issue number (GitHub issue numbers never reach 2 billion).
 *   2. {@link ReportGhClient} — a network-free {@link GhClient} that returns a
 *      synthesized {@link Prd} instead of shelling out to `gh`.
 *   3. {@link buildDebugReport} / {@link wireDebugSpecDeps} — render the
 *      synthetic PRD body from confirmed blockers, and wire a
 *      `SpecBuildDeps` that swaps in `ReportGhClient` while reusing the SAME
 *      `SpecStore`/`dataDir` as real specs (debug specs are isolated from real
 *      PRD-issue specs purely by the synthetic issue-number range, never by a
 *      separate store).
 *
 * `resolveSpec`/`gateSpec`/`storeSpec` themselves are imported UNCHANGED from
 * `src/cli/subcommands/spec.ts` — this module never forks or reimplements
 * them; only the `SpecBuildDeps` passed in differs.
