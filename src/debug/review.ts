/**
 * Whole-scope review harness (Decision 39's `/factory:debug` rebuild) — two
 * halves, one file: adjudication (Task 1, below) and the committed e2e
 * fold-in (Task 2, at the bottom). Both feed the SAME confirmed-blockers
 * gate so `/factory:debug`'s stop condition is a single check
 * (`confirmedBlockers.length === 0`) across review findings AND e2e
 * failures.
 *
 * `/factory:debug` reuses the SAME risk-invariant judgment layer the per-task
 * merge gate uses — citation-verify (Δ K) → independent finding-verifier (D27) →
 * per-reviewer adjudication — but applied to a WHOLE-SCOPE diff instead of one
 * task's diff. This module composes the EXISTING judgment/record exports
 * UNCHANGED (`buildPanelManifest`, `runPanel`, `parseRawReview`,
 * `buildWorktreeSource`, `makeReplayRunnerFactory`); it reimplements none of
 * citation-verify, confirmation, or panel construction. It also reuses
 * `runE2e` (`src/verifier/e2e/index.ts`) UNCHANGED for the e2e half — see
 * that section's header, further down, for its own notes.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow surface: debug consumes ONLY `runPanel`'s
 * `result.adjudicated`. `result.mergeGate` and `result.result` are per-task-phase
 * -shaped (they assume a single task's deterministic gate + phase-advance
 * semantics) and are not meaningful for a whole-scope review, so this module
 * never reads or re-exports them. `gateEvidence: []` is passed to `runPanel`
 * because whole-scope review has no per-task deterministic gate evidence to
 * combine — note this makes `deriveAllGatesVerdict`'s deterministic half (and so
 * `mergeGate.passed`/`result.result`) UNCONDITIONALLY fail-closed (an empty
 * evidence set never passes, by `deriveAllGatesVerdict`'s "nothing ran is never a
 * pass" rule in `src/core/state/derive.ts`) — harmless here because this module
 * never reads either field, but a real trap for any future caller that decides to
 * start reading `result.mergeGate`/`result.result` off of this call.

 * ({@link adjudicateWholeScope}, above) AND the repo's COMMITTED Playwright
 * e2e suite. This section reuses {@link runE2e}
 * (`src/verifier/e2e/index.ts`) UNCHANGED — it reimplements none of
 * Playwright invocation, JSON-reporter parsing, or pass/fail
 * classification — and folds its per-spec failures into synthetic
 * {@link Finding}s.
 *
 * Env-builder note: the Playwright env comes from `scrubbedE2eEnv`
 * (`src/orchestrator/e2e-paths.ts`) — the same allowlisted builder the run
 * coroutine uses. The missing-config behavior DIFFERS from that coroutine
 * on purpose: the run coroutine SUSPENDS the whole run when
 * `e2e.startCommand`/`e2e.baseURL` are unset (`runE2eEmit`); debug's rule
 * is softer — {@link runCommittedE2e} returns `{kind: "skipped", ...}` and
 * the caller keeps looping on review findings alone, never suspending.
 *
 * Citation-verify note: e2e findings are constructed directly here, not
 * parsed via `parseRawReview` / run through `adjudicateWholeScope`'s
 * citation-verify — they are not reviewer prose citing source, they are a
 * mechanical Playwright report. {@link foldE2eIntoBlockers} merges them
 * into `confirmedBlockers` POST-adjudication, un-citation-verified, by
 * design. They are still constructed schema-valid against
 * {@link Finding} (both `file`+`line` present or both absent; `quote`
 * always non-empty) for consistency, in case anything ever re-parses them.
