/**
 * The run-level E2E COROUTINE (Decision 39) — mirrors `docs.ts`'s emit/record split,
 * ordered BEFORE it (`src/orchestrator/next.ts`'s `wantsE2e`).
 *
 * Unlike docs (one LLM pass, never re-entered), e2e has TWO very different kinds of
 * work:
 *   - AUTHORING a suite (needs an LLM + live-app exploration) — happens EXACTLY ONCE
 *     per run, on the first e2e entry (`run.e2e_phase === undefined`).
 *   - RUNNING the suite + deciding what to do with the result (fully mechanical —
 *     shells Playwright via `runE2e`, no LLM) — happens on EVERY entry, including
 *     every re-entry after a reopened task settles back to terminal.
 *
 * Spawns exist in three places (all `kind: "spawn"`, discriminated by `expects`):
 * the first-entry AUTHOR spawn, its crash-retry re-spawn (D5), and the ADJUDICATOR
 * spawn (D7 — a pre-existing committed spec failed unmappably and needs a
 * regression-vs-intentional-change ruling). Every other call drives
 * `runSuiteAndDecide` and returns a CONCLUSIVE action (`done` | `failed` |
 * `reopen` | `suspend`). The runner therefore loops while `kind === "spawn"`,
 * picking the results shape off `expects`; every other kind means "state already
 * updated, no agent needed, continue the next-task loop."
 *
 * Ordering vs. commit (a deliberate refinement over the plan's literal worked
 * example): the fail-first proof runs BEFORE the critical specs are merged into
 * staging, using the author's own (not-yet-merged) worktree as the proof's
 * "staging-side" run and a scratch worktree off the base branch as the "base-side"
 * run. A spec that fails the proof (vacuous / base-unusable) therefore NEVER lands
 * in the target repo's committed `e2e/` — only a PROVEN spec is merged. The plan's
 * literal ordering ("commit; then prove") would otherwise permanently pollute the
 * committed suite with a rejected spec on the fail path.
 *
 * Reopen mechanics reuse `resetTaskRow` (Decision 39) — the SAME primitive rescue
 * uses — with a fresh `e2eFeedback` override; `e2e_feedback` then reaches both
 * producer roles via the existing `PriorFailureNote` channel (handlers.ts).
 *
 * This file is the FACADE of the split coroutine: the emit/record dispatch plus the
 * public re-export surface. The legs live in `e2e-author.ts` (authoring + its record
 * gates), `e2e-suite.ts` (mechanical suite run + the D7 adjudication sub-machine),
 * `e2e-proof.ts` (the fail-first proof), and `e2e-shared.ts` (types + phase writers).
