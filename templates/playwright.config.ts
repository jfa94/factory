 * Seeded by `factory scaffold` (Decision 39) — then PROJECT-OWNED (never
 * auto-overwritten; delete + re-scaffold to pick up a template update).
 *
 * `testDir` MUST match the factory's `e2e.testDir` config (default "e2e") —
 * persistence in that directory IS the criticality signal for the run-level
 * e2e phase: nothing is tagged, so this directory boundary is load-bearing.
 *
 * The `webServer.command`/`url` fallbacks below are scaffold placeholders: the
 * run-start e2e ASSESSMENT (Decision 40) resolves this repo's real dev/start
 * command + base URL and writes them in on the first `--e2e` run. You can also
 * set them yourself, or override per-repo via `factory configure --set
 * e2e.startCommand=<cmd> --set e2e.baseURL=<url>` (config overrides win). The
 * run-level e2e phase passes `FACTORY_E2E_*` env vars into every Playwright
 * invocation, and `webServer` below reads them, so both the factory's
 * mechanical runs AND a plain local/CI `playwright test` boot the app the
 * same way.
