# Dark Factory Plugin — Quality Gates, Review Gates & Configuration

## 5-Layer Quality Gate Stack

Every task-executor output passes through all 5 layers before review. Layers are sequential — a failure at any layer blocks progression to the next.

### Layer 1: Static Analysis

**Purpose:** Catch syntax errors, lint violations, type errors, formatting issues before tests run.

**Trigger:** Automatic — fires on every commit attempt via existing user hooks.

**Plugin component:** None needed. The user's existing `.claude/` hooks fire automatically for all plugin agents:

- `pre-commit-check` hook (60s timeout): lint, format, type check
- `dangerous-patterns-check`: blocks known dangerous code patterns
- `compound-check`: multi-rule validation
- Prettier PostToolUse hook: auto-formats after Edit/Write

**Pass criteria:** All hooks exit 0.

**Failure action:** task-executor receives hook error output, fixes the issue, retries commit. Max 3 internal retries.

**Why this works:** Hooks are un-bypassable. Agent instructions to "follow coding standards" are followed ~70% of the time; hooks enforce at 100%.

### Layer 2: Test Suite

**Purpose:** Verify implementation correctness against existing and new tests.

**Trigger:** Automatic — existing Stop hook runs vitest when agent session ends.

**Plugin component:** None needed. User's existing Stop hook handles this.

**Pass criteria:** All tests pass (exit 0).

**Failure action:** task-executor receives test output, fixes failing tests or implementation. Max 3 internal retries. CRITICAL: never modify existing tests to make them pass — fix the implementation.

**Evidence:** AI-generated code has 67.3% PR rejection rate (LinearB) — most failures are caught here.

### Layer 3: Coverage Regression

**Purpose:** Ensure new code doesn't decrease test coverage. Agents are known to delete failing tests to improve metrics — this catches that.

**Trigger:** After test suite passes. Called by orchestrator.

**Plugin component:** `bin/pipeline-coverage-gate` (deterministic script)

**Interface:**

```
pipeline-coverage-gate <before.json> <after.json>
  Exit 0: coverage maintained or increased
  Exit 1: coverage decreased (stdout: diff details)
```

**Pass criteria:** Line coverage, branch coverage, and function coverage must not decrease vs baseline.

**Failure action:** task-executor must add tests to restore coverage. Orchestrator re-runs coverage gate after fix.

**Evidence:** "Coverage as regression signal" — treat coverage as a floor, not an optimization target. Research shows AI agents delete failing tests rather than fixing implementations when under pressure.

### Layer 4: Holdout Validation

**Purpose:** Verify that the implementation genuinely satisfies the spec, not just the explicit instructions. Withhold a percentage of acceptance criteria from the task-executor, then check if those criteria are met anyway.

**Trigger:** After coverage gate passes. Called by orchestrator.

**Plugin components:**

- `bin/pipeline-build-prompt --holdout N%` — deterministically selects and withholds N% of acceptance criteria from the task prompt. Withheld criteria stored in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/holdouts/{run_id}/{task_id}.json`
- Holdout evaluation — orchestrator (or dedicated subagent) reviews implementation against withheld criteria

**Pass criteria:** ≥80% of withheld criteria are satisfied without being explicitly requested. Threshold configurable via `userConfig.quality.holdoutPassRate`.

**Failure action:** If <80% holdout criteria met, the implementation is surface-level (satisfies letter but not spirit of spec). Task-executor receives the full spec (including previously withheld criteria) and re-implements. Holdout validation is NOT repeated on re-implementation (would be unfair).

**Evidence:** StrongDM Attractor pattern: 6-7K NLSpec → 32K+ production code. Holdout validation catches "teaching to the test" — implementations that literally do only what's asked without understanding the broader requirement.

### Layer 5: Mutation Testing

**Purpose:** Verify test quality by measuring mutation score. AI-generated tests often achieve high line coverage but low mutation scores (tautological tests that assert what was written, not what should work).

**Trigger:** After holdout validation passes. Called by orchestrator. ONLY for feature-tier and security-tier tasks (skip for routine).

**Plugin component:** Orchestrator spawns existing `test-writer` agent to kill surviving mutants.

**Pass criteria:** Mutation score ≥80% (configurable via `userConfig.quality.mutationScoreTarget`).

**Failure action:** `test-writer` agent generates targeted tests for surviving mutants. Re-run mutation testing. Max 2 rounds of mutation test improvement.

**Evidence:** AI-generated tests: 85-95% line coverage but only 30-40% mutation scores. Industry target: >80%. AI code has 15-25% higher mutation survival rates than human code.

## Adversarial Code Review Design

**This is the most important step in the pipeline.** The review gate is the last defense before code reaches a pull request. It must be adversarial — actively trying to break code, not just validating it.

### Actor-Critic Pattern

The review follows the Actor-Critic adversarial pattern:

- **Actor (Builder)** = task-executor agent. Optimistic, fast implementation. Knows the spec, has implementation context.
- **Critic (Reviewer)** = task-reviewer agent or Codex. Paranoid adversary. Reviews COLD — zero knowledge of implementation process, zero ability to modify code to ease validation. Treats produced code as a hostile artifact.

The asymmetry is critical: the Critic has different incentives than the Actor. The Critic's job is to find ALL issues, not to be helpful or encouraging. This breaks the "echo chamber" where a single agent validates its own work.

### Multi-Round Review Loop

```
Round 1: Critic reviews → finds issues → REQUEST_CHANGES
Round 2: Actor fixes → Critic re-reviews → finds fewer issues → REQUEST_CHANGES
Round 3: Actor fixes → Critic re-reviews → APPROVE (or escalate)
```

**Round configuration by risk tier:**

| Risk Tier | Max Rounds | Additional Reviewers                          | Cost Estimate (API/overage only) |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Routine   | 2          | None                                          | ~$0.05-$0.10                     |
| Feature   | 4          | None                                          | ~$0.20-$0.50                     |
| Security  | 6          | `security-reviewer` + `architecture-reviewer` | ~$0.50-$1.00                     |

**Note:** Cost estimates apply only when billing via API key or extra usage overage. Subscription allowance users show $0 cost (pre-paid flat rate). Billing mode is auto-detected from response headers (`unified-*` = subscription, standard `ratelimit-*` = API).

**Exit conditions:**

- APPROVE → exit loop, proceed to PR
- REQUEST_CHANGES + rounds remaining → Actor fixes, re-review
- REQUEST_CHANGES + max rounds reached → escalate to human
- NEEDS_DISCUSSION → escalate to human immediately (ambiguity requires human judgment)

**Evidence:** Actor-Critic eliminates 90%+ issues in 3-5 rounds. Autonoma: 73% more issues caught, 71% fewer bugs, 42% less review time. Cost: ~$0.20-$1.00/feature vs $50-$100/hr human review (50-500x savings).

### Codex-First Detection

The pipeline checks for OpenAI Codex availability FIRST because Codex has a purpose-built adversarial review mode designed specifically for pressure-testing assumptions.

**Detection script:** `bin/pipeline-detect-reviewer` (deterministic)

```
pipeline-detect-reviewer
  Checks:
    1. command -v codex  → Codex CLI installed?
    2. codex status --auth → authenticated?
  Output (stdout JSON):
    If both pass:  {"reviewer": "codex", "command": "codex adversarial-review --base <ref> --wait"}
    If either fail: {"reviewer": "claude-code", "agent": "task-reviewer"}
  Exit 0 always (detection never fails, just selects fallback)
```

**Codex review invocation:**

- `/codex:adversarial-review --base <ref> --wait` (synchronous)
- `/codex:adversarial-review --base <ref> --background` (asynchronous)
- Codex adversarial mode specifically pressure-tests assumptions, checks for edge cases, and performs threat modeling

**Claude Code fallback:**

- Spawn `task-reviewer` agent with `review-protocol` skill injected
- OR spawn existing `code-reviewer` agent with `review-protocol` skill for non-pipeline reviews
- Both produce output normalized by `pipeline-parse-review`

### review-protocol Skill

The `review-protocol` skill injects Actor-Critic methodology into whichever reviewer is selected. It provides consistent review behavior regardless of vendor.

**Skill instructions include:**

1. **Adversarial posture** — treat code as a hostile artifact. Assume it's wrong until proven correct.
2. **Security audit** — check for injection, XSS, auth bypass, secret exposure, OWASP Top 10
3. **Acceptance criteria verification** — check every criterion is genuinely satisfied (not just superficially)
4. **AI anti-pattern detection:**
   - Hallucinated APIs (calling functions/methods that don't exist)
   - Over-abstraction (premature helpers, unnecessary indirection)
   - Copy-paste drift (similar but subtly different code blocks)
   - Dead code (unused imports, unreachable branches)
   - Excessive I/O (unnecessary file reads, redundant API calls)
   - Sycophantic generation (code that looks good but doesn't work)
   - Infinite code problem (unbounded growth without convergence)
5. **Structured verdict output** — must output APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or NEEDS_DISCUSSION with specific findings

### Verdict Normalization

`bin/pipeline-parse-review` (deterministic script) normalizes output from both Codex and Claude Code reviewers:

```
pipeline-parse-review
  Input: stdin (raw reviewer output — Codex JSON or Claude Code text)
  Output: stdout JSON
    {
      "verdict": "APPROVE" | "REQUEST_CHANGES" | "NEEDS_DISCUSSION",
      "findings": [
        {
          "severity": "critical" | "major" | "minor" | "suggestion",
          "file": "src/auth.ts",
          "line": 42,
          "description": "SQL injection via unsanitized user input",
          "category": "security" | "correctness" | "performance" | "style" | "anti-pattern"
        }
      ],
      "round": 1,
      "reviewer": "codex" | "claude-code",
      "summary": "..."
    }
  Exit 0: parsed successfully
  Exit 1: parse failure (raw output preserved in state for debugging)
```

## Human Review Gate Design

Configurable levels of human oversight, controlled by `userConfig.humanReviewLevel`:

### Level 0: Full Autonomy

Pipeline creates PR and enables auto-merge. Human reviews merged code post-hoc.

- Adversarial review must APPROVE
- All quality gates must pass
- **Risk:** bugs reach main branch before human review
- **Use case:** low-risk routine tasks, strong test coverage, trusted codebase

### Level 1: PR Approval (default)

Pipeline runs end-to-end, creates PR. Human reviews and merges.

- Pipeline provides: diff, review summary, quality gate results, metrics
- Human decides: merge, request changes, or close
- **Use case:** standard autonomous workflow

### Level 2: Review Checkpoint

Pipeline pauses after adversarial code review, before PR creation. Human signs off on the reviewed code.

- Human sees: code diff + all review round results + quality gate results
- Human decides: proceed to PR, request more changes, or abort
- **Use case:** solo dev who trusts spec but wants to see code before PR

### Level 3: Spec Approval

Pipeline pauses after spec generation. Human reviews spec + tasks.json before execution begins.

- Human sees: spec document + task decomposition + dependency graph
- Human decides: approve spec (execution begins), revise spec, or abort
- **Use case:** team repos where architecture decisions need sign-off

### Level 4: Full Supervision

Human approves at every stage: spec review, task decomposition, each task execution, each review round, PR creation.

- Pipeline pauses at each gate, presents results, waits for human
- **Use case:** first run on a new codebase, learning the pipeline's behavior

## Rate Limit Detection

### Detection Flow

Usage data comes from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/usage-cache.json`, written by
`bin/statusline-wrapper.sh` on every Claude Code statusline update. The statusline
JSON provides real-time `rate_limits` data — no API calls, no token cost.

```
Before each task-executor spawn:
  1. pipeline-quota-check
     → Read: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/usage-cache.json
     → Parse five_hour.used_percentage, five_hour.resets_at
     → Parse seven_day.used_percentage, seven_day.resets_at
     → Calculate 5h position: window_hour = floor((now - (resets_at - 5h)) / 3600) + 1  [1-5]
                               hourly_threshold = min(window_hour * 20, 90)
     → Calculate 7d position: window_day = floor((now - (resets_at - 7d)) / 86400) + 1  [1-7]
                               thresholds = [14, 29, 43, 57, 71, 86, 95]
                               daily_threshold = thresholds[window_day - 1]
     → Output: {
         "five_hour":  { "utilization": N, "hourly_threshold": T, "over_threshold": bool,
                         "window_hour": N, "resets_at_epoch": N },
         "seven_day":  { "utilization": N, "daily_threshold": T, "over_threshold": bool,
                         "window_day": N, "resets_at_epoch": N },
         "detection_method": "statusline"
       }

  2. pipeline-model-router --quota <quota-check-output> --tier <tier>
     → Composes 5h and 7d results:

       CASE: both within limits
         → provider: anthropic, action: proceed

       CASE: 5h over threshold, 7d within limits
         → action: wait
         → wait_minutes derived from resets_at_epoch (session-anchored, not UTC boundary)
         → retry with Claude after sleep

       CASE: 7d over threshold
         → action: end_gracefully
         → Stop spawning new tasks, let in-flight complete, mark run as "partial"
```

## Observability & Metrics

### Audit Logging

**Hook:** `run-tracker` (PostToolUse, fires on every tool call while a run is active)

Every tool use by every agent in the pipeline is logged to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs/{run_id}/audit.jsonl`. The hook keeps the on-disk record narrow on purpose — it stores the inputs needed to verify chain integrity and the metadata needed to correlate entries with run state, but does NOT store raw tool inputs (which can be large or contain secrets).

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-06T03:14:15Z",
  "run_id": "run_abc123",
  "tool": "Write",
  "params_hash": "9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08",
  "prev_hash": "GENESIS",
  "hash": "f5eb1c3c2f3e3e8bb5a1f73e2d9d6e44a8b4e3a1f4c7c0d6e9b3a2f1e0d9c8b7",
  "seq": 1
}
```

| Field         | Meaning                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timestamp`   | UTC, second-resolution (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`).                                                          |
| `run_id`      | Active run, derived from the `runs/current` symlink.                                                    |
| `tool`        | Tool name from the hook input (`tool_name`).                                                            |
| `params_hash` | SHA256 of the tool input JSON. Inputs themselves are not stored.                                        |
| `prev_hash`   | Chain hash of the previous entry, or `"GENESIS"` for the first entry of the run.                        |
| `hash`        | `SHA256(prev_hash \|\| params_hash)` — re-ordering or deletion breaks the chain.                        |
| `seq`         | Monotonic 1-based sequence within the run; derived under a per-run mutex so parallel hooks cannot race. |

The hook mutex is a portable `mkdir`-based lock under `<run_dir>/.run-tracker.lock`; if the lock cannot be acquired in ~10s the hook logs an error and exits 0 (it never blocks tool execution). On Linux the SHA256 helper prefers `sha256sum` (coreutils); macOS falls back to `shasum -a 256` — see `hooks/run-tracker.sh::_sha256`.

**Verification:** `hooks/run-tracker.sh --verify <run_dir>` walks `audit.jsonl`, recomputes the chain, and exits 0 (valid) / 1 (broken) with a JSON status. Used by tests and on-demand integrity checks.

**EU AI Act compliance (Aug 2026):**

- Tamper-evident logs ✓ (hash chain over `params_hash`).
- Tool provenance ✓ (each entry names the tool that ran).
- Human oversight records ✓ (`humanReviewLevel` gate transitions live in `state.json`, not `audit.jsonl`; the two together reconstruct the full trail).
- Delegation / model provenance — the audit log proves _what_ tools ran in what order; per-task model and agent attribution lives in `state.json` and the `pipeline-metrics` MCP server, not in `audit.jsonl`. Combine the three sources for a full delegation trace.

### Metrics MCP Server

**Server:** `pipeline-metrics` (defined in `.mcp.json`)

**Storage:** Local SQLite or JSON (configurable via `observability.metricsExport`)

**Tools exposed:**

- `record` — write a metric event
- `query` — read metrics with filters (run_id, task_id, date range, event_type)
- `export` — dump all metrics for a run as JSON

**Metric schema:**

```json
