# Pipeline Runner — the session runner

The `factory` CLI owns every decision: phases, gates, classification, the escalation
ladder, the merge gate, holdout ordering, quota, cascade-fails, deadlock detection,
PR creation, and merging. You own exactly three verbs: **call the CLI, spawn what an
envelope names, feed the raw results back.**

## Iron Laws

1. **Never decide a transition.** The only next action is what the last envelope said.
   You never edit `state.json`, never re-order steps, never re-run a step to "check".
2. **Spawn exactly what the manifest says; collect output verbatim.** Role, model
   (mapped per the alias table), max_turns, isolation per the matrix. Never edit a
   finding, never form your own verdict on the code.
3. **Fail loud.** An unknown envelope `kind`, an unexpected non-zero exit, a deadlock
   error → STOP and surface it. A loud CLI error is a real defect — read the message;
   never blind-retry.

## Phase 0 — Preconditions

1. Confirm a git checkout: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. If not, stop.
2. Confirm autonomous mode: `factory autonomy preflight` (exits 0 to proceed, 1 to halt).
   It auto-scaffolds `merged-settings.json` when the session is not autonomous OR the
   settings are stale/missing/unstamped, and prints the relaunch command. The pipeline
   runs unattended — `run create`/`resume` HALT loud otherwise. On a non-zero exit,
   relay the printed `claude --settings <merged-settings.json>` command to the user and
   stop (the relaunch is the user's irreducible step; a running session cannot make
   itself autonomous). `factory autonomy status`/`ensure` remain the manual primitives.
3. `factory scaffold` (idempotent; `--repo` is OPTIONAL — auto-derived from the
   `origin` remote, pass `--repo <owner/name>` only to override. Refuses if staging
   branch protection is missing → tell the user to re-run with `--provision` or
   protect staging manually, then stop).

## Phase 1 — Spec (unchanged, durable, apex-gated)

`--repo` below is OPTIONAL on every `factory spec` action — the CLI auto-derives it
from the `origin` remote of the current checkout; pass `--repo <o/n>` only to
override. Run the bounded generate ⇄ review loop until `reuse` or `stored`:

Pass `--supersede` to `resolve` when the invoking command forwarded it — `resolve`
skips the reuse check so the loop always emits `generate` (never `reuse`). The old
durable spec SURVIVES the whole loop; `spec store` replaces it only after the new
spec passes gate + review. If the issue's active run is weekly-parked (7d quota
window), `resolve --supersede` emits `pause` instead of regenerating — superseding
would strand the parked run. Forward the invoking command's `--ignore-quota` to
`resolve` verbatim.

```
env = factory spec resolve [--repo <o/n>] --issue <n> [--supersede] [--ignore-quota]
loop on env.kind:
  reuse | stored → done (env.pointer); go to Phase 2
  pause → STOP unconditionally (ALL scopes — 5h, 7d, unavailable: no run or heartbeat
      exists in Phase 1, so there is nothing to park). Spawn NOTHING. Report
      env.scope/env.reason/env.resets_at_epoch to the user; re-run after the window
      resets, or with --ignore-quota to override.
  unspecifiable → STOP LOUD (exit 1; zero agent cost). Surface env.blockers to the
      user verbatim — the PRD needs editing before the factory can spec it. Spawn NOTHING.
  spec-defect → STOP LOUD (exit 1). The ENGINE exhausted the regen bound
      (env.iterations/env.max_iterations); surface env.reason + env.blockers verbatim —
      the PRD needs rework. Spawn NOTHING.
  generate → spawn env.spawn.agent_type VERBATIM (worktree, opus) with env.spawn.context embedded
      write its GenerateResult JSON verbatim to env.generated_path
      env = factory spec gate [--repo <o/n>] --issue <n>
  revise → spawn env.spawn.agent_type VERBATIM (worktree, opus) with env.spawn.context embedded
      (env.spawn.context already carries the prior spec + the blockers to fix — the
       agent PATCHES it; it does NOT re-author from scratch. Do not hand-assemble context.)
      (the ENGINE counts regenerations in scratch attempts.json — the runner counts nothing)
      write its GenerateResult JSON verbatim to env.generated_path
      env = factory spec gate [--repo <o/n>] --issue <n>
  review → spawn env.spawn.agent_type VERBATIM (worktree, opus) with env.spawn.context embedded
      write its ReviewVerdict JSON to env.verdict_path
      env = factory spec store [--repo <o/n>] --issue <n>
```

Generator/reviewer follow `agents/spec-generator.md` / `agents/spec-reviewer.md`; the
CLI validates their JSON loudly — never coerce a malformed payload.

## Phase 2 — Create

```bash
factory run create [--repo <owner/name>] (--issue <n> | --spec-id <id>) [--run-id <id>] [--new] [--supersede | --resume] [--no-ship] [--ignore-quota] [--approve-spec] --session-id "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"
```

`--repo` is OPTIONAL — auto-derived from the `origin` remote of the current checkout (pass it only
to override; an explicit value that disagrees with the remote fails loud). Forward the invoking
command's `--no-ship`/`--ignore-quota` flags verbatim (default — no flag: live); the resolved
`ship_mode` persists on the run and is read back by resume + finalize, so it is never re-marshaled. Always pass `--session-id "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"` — this stamps THIS
runner session as the run's `owner_session`, so the Stop gate resolves only the owning
session's run and never acts on a _different_ session's run (Prompt J). The shell expands
the env var; if it is unset it expands to empty and the CLI degrades to owner-unknown (unscoped Stop
gate) — never a bogus empty owner. On success `run create` emits `{kind:"created"|"superseded", run}` —
read `run_id` from `.run.run_id` (not a bare RunState). Seed failures (duplicate/dangling/cyclic deps)
are spec defects — surface them.

**No silent reuse (Decision 35).** `run create` never adopts an existing run. If an active run already
exists for the spec, it exits `3`. Two distinct envelopes — check `kind` first:

- `{kind:"pause", scope:"7d", run_id, status, reason, resets_at_epoch?}` — the existing run
  is parked on the weekly quota window. **Hard stop: do NOT prompt, do NOT supersede.** Surface the
  reason + reset time and tell the user to `/factory:resume` after the window resets. The only override
  is `--ignore-quota` (user must pass it explicitly to this command, which forwards it to `run create`).
- `{kind:"exists", existing:{run_id, status}}` — generic active-run conflict. If the invoking command
  forwarded `--supersede` or `--resume`, `run create` already acted on it — no prompt. Otherwise
  surface the conflict to `/factory:run`, which prompts the user (`AskUserQuestion`: resume / supersede /
  cancel) and re-invokes with the chosen flag. Do NOT re-run bare `create` in a loop hoping it sticks,
  and do NOT hand-pick the existing run — the flag is the only sanctioned escape.

Pass `--new` (or an explicit `--run-id`) to force an unconditional fresh run with a distinct id.

**`--approve-spec` (S9, Decision 47).** Forward the invoking command's flag verbatim. When set,
creation completes in full (staging cut, tasks seeded) and the run is then parked — `suspended`
with NO quota checkpoint — before any envelope reaches the loop; the `created`/`superseded`
envelope carries `spec_approval: {spec_path, note}`. **STOP there**: report `spec_path` and tell
the user to review the spec and run `/factory:resume` (resume IS the sign-off). Do NOT call
`next-task` on a parked run — its quota-gate step clears suspensions and would silently un-park.
Runners are otherwise unchanged.

**Autonomy gate:** `run create` HALTS loud (`NotAutonomousError`, non-zero exit) if the runner
session is not autonomous (`FACTORY_AUTONOMOUS_MODE=1`). This is the deterministic engine refusing to
start an unattended pipeline in an interactive session — not a transient error. Surface the relaunch
instruction (Phase 0 step 2); never retry blindly.

**Enter the orchestrator worktree (Decision 2).** `run create` already materialised the run's
staging branch in a dedicated worktree at `.claude/worktrees/orchestrator-<run_id>` — the engine
NEVER checks staging out in the user's primary checkout (doing so parked the main dir on staging and
later phase-merge checkouts collided with `already used by worktree` — smoke defect D2). `cd` into it
now, before the loop, so subagent `baseRef:"head"` worktrees fork from the staging tip and every
foreground `factory` call runs isolated from the user's checkout:

```bash
ORCH="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.claude/worktrees/orchestrator-<run_id>"   # <run_id> = .run.run_id
cd "$ORCH"
```

Run all of Phase 3+ (every `factory` call and every `Agent` spawn) from `$ORCH`. **On resume**
(`/factory:resume`), re-derive `$ORCH` and `cd` in before the loop; if it was pruned between sessions
recreate it idempotently from the run's already-existing staging branch:
`[ -d "$ORCH" ] || git worktree add "$ORCH" "$(factory state <run_id> | jq -r .staging_branch)"`.
**Teardown** (best-effort, at the run's terminal report): `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` then
`git worktree remove --force "$ORCH"`. Leaving it is harmless (each run's dir is unique — no collision),
so teardown is a nicety, not correctness.

## Phase 3 — THE LOOP (parallel event loop)

The ship mode is persisted on the run (Phase 2's `run create`); `next-task`, `next-action`, and `finalize` all
read it from state — never re-pass it and never choose it yourself.

**You are the multiplexer.** Background subagents cannot spawn agents, so the main
session drives everything: ALL `factory` CLI calls run FOREGROUND in this session,
one at a time (never a background Bash) — that yields one-driver-per-task by
construction. ONLY `Agent()` spawns run in the background (`run_in_background: true`).

**The in-flight table.** Track `task_id → { result_key, wave, agent task-ids }` for
every task you are currently driving. It is a rebuildable cache held in conversation
context ONLY — the state file is truth. Never persist it anywhere (not to disk, not
to results files).

**The non-completion heartbeat (S1/3c self-heal).** A background completion is not the
only event that must re-enter this loop — a spawn that silently dies produces none, so
`work.stale` (below) would otherwise never be observed inside a live session. Before the
first REFILL, arm ONE session-scoped recurring wake sized to the configured TTL:

```bash
TTL_MIN=$(factory config-defaults | jq -r .stallTtlMinutes)   # default 15
```

```
CronCreate({
  cron: "*/<TTL_MIN> * * * *", recurring: true,
  prompt: "Heartbeat for factory run <run_id>: re-enter skills/pipeline-runner/SKILL.md
    Phase 3 REFILL. If the run is now terminal or this session no longer has an
    in-flight table for it, CronDelete this job and do nothing else. A run that is
    `paused` mid-5h-quota-wait is NOT terminal — keep firing so REFILL re-checks the gate."
})
```

One job for the run's whole lifetime — CronCreate jobs already recur on their own;
never re-arm per turn. It fires only while the session is idle (exactly the "WAIT: end
the turn" window below), so it never races a call in flight. Best-effort teardown:
`CronDelete` it once Phase 4 (report) is reached — like the worktree teardown, leaving
it is harmless (its own prompt self-deletes it against a terminal run) but tidy.

```
REFILL (run at loop entry and after every completion):
  env = factory next-task --run <run_id>                       # foreground
  case env.kind:
    "done"      → go to Phase 4 (report)
    "finalize"  → factory run finalize --run <run_id>; if the finalized run's
                  status is "failed", run factory rescue auto --run <run_id>
                  (the bounded self-heal, S10/Decision 48+60). Fire it after
                  EVERY failed finalize — the CLI enforces the ≤3-cycle budget
                  and pages once it is spent, so the runner stays dumb:
                    kind "recovered" → REFILL (back to the top of THE LOOP)
                    kind "page"      → report its reason/dead_ends/hints, go to Phase 4
                  otherwise go to Phase 4
    "e2e"       → run the E2E STAGE (below); on done/failed/reopen, REFILL; on suspend,
                  report the reason + STOP (run is suspended — /factory:resume retries)
    "e2e-assessment" → run the E2E-ASSESSMENT STAGE (below); on done/failed, REFILL
                  (failed sweeps every task — next-task routes to finalize)
    "traceability" → run the TRACEABILITY STAGE (below); on done/failed, REFILL
                  (failed = run condemned OR crash-at-cap — next-task routes to
                  finalize, docs skipped); on suspend, report the reason + STOP
                  (run is suspended — /factory:resume retries)
    "document"  → run the DOCS STAGE (below); on done, REFILL; on suspend,
                  report the reason + STOP (run is suspended — /factory:resume retries)
    "pause"     → PAUSE CONVERGENCE (below)
    "work"      → # HARD wall-clock kill FIRST (env.hung, disjoint from env.stale — no
                  # dedupe needed). The engine's hungSpawnMinutes verdict is final:
                  # NO liveness check — past the hard cap a still-running agent is
                  # hung, not slow (Decision 66).
                  for each id in env.hung:
                    TaskStop every tracked agent id for it, EVEN IF STILL RUNNING
                    (not in the table — compaction/context-loss: TaskStop any TaskList
                    agent you can attribute to it, then proceed the same way)
                    remove the task from the table (if tracked)
                    tenv = factory next-action --run <run_id> --task <task>   # WITHOUT --results
                    case tenv.kind:
                      "spawn" → spawn per the collection contract + spawn rule below;
                                add the task back to the table
                      "done"  → report tenv.outcome (once the engine's re-drive budget
                                — SPAWN_REDRIVE_CAP — is spent it FAILS the task;
                                finalize + rescue auto own recovery from there);
                                REFILL again
                      "pause" → PAUSE CONVERGENCE
                  # then the S1/3c advisory self-heal, before the ready-fill loop, so a
                  # revived task reclaims its slot ahead of new work:
                  for each id in env.stale that IS in the table:
                    check TaskList for whether its tracked agent task-ids are still
                    running. If ANY still is → false positive (a slow-but-alive spawn,
                    e.g. a deep verify panel that outlived the TTL) — do NOT touch it;
                    the heartbeat re-checks next cycle. This liveness check is the ONLY
                    guard against killing a live spawn: there is no safe non-destructive
                    way to "just refresh spawned_at" on a timer — the sole re-drive
                    mechanism (orchestrator.ts, on next-action re-entry) resets the task
                    worktree to its checkpoint tip, so a periodic no-op ping would itself
                    destroy a live agent's uncommitted/committed-since-spawn work.
                    Else (every tracked agent already finished/errored/unaccounted-for):
                      TaskStop each tracked agent id (harmless if already dead)
                      remove the task from the table
                      tenv = factory next-action --run <run_id> --task <task>   # WITHOUT --results
                      case tenv.kind:
                        "spawn" → spawn per the collection contract + spawn rule below;
                                  add the task back to the table
                        "done"  → report tenv.outcome; REFILL again
                        "pause" → PAUSE CONVERGENCE
                  for each id in env.stale NOT in the table (compaction/context-loss —
                  nothing tracked to liveness-check): re-drive it the same way (idempotent
                  per the Compaction recovery note below).
                  then, for each task in env.ready (order preserved — in-flight tasks are
                  listed first) that is NOT already in the table, while the table has
                  fewer than env.max_parallel tasks:
                    tenv = factory next-action --run <run_id> --task <task>   # foreground
                    case tenv.kind:
                      "spawn" → spawn EVERY entry in tenv.manifest.agents IN THE
                                BACKGROUND (count-agnostic — spawn however many the
                                manifest names, never assume a panel size), per the
                                collection contract + spawn rule below; add the task
                                to the table with tenv.result_key + the agent ids
                      "done"  → report tenv.outcome (a drop is loud + classified);
                                REFILL again (a terminal task may unblock dependents)
                      "pause" → PAUSE CONVERGENCE
                  then WAIT: end the turn. A background agent completion OR the
                  heartbeat re-invokes you — never busy-poll.

ON AGENT COMPLETION (a background agent finishes):
  Collect its output (TaskOutput) and mark it in the table.
  Reviews wave only: when ALL sidecar+panel agents are in, spawn the finding-verifiers
    (background, one per blocking+citable finding — the verify-then-fix contract below)
    as the same wave's second stage; wait for those too.
  When ALL results of the task's current wave are in:
    write the results file (per the collection contract), then
    tenv = factory next-action --run <run_id> --task <task> --results <file>   # foreground
    case tenv.kind:
      "spawn" → next wave: spawn every manifest agent in the background; update the
                table with the new result_key + agent ids
      "done"  → remove the task from the table; report tenv.outcome
      "pause" → PAUSE CONVERGENCE
    then REFILL (a finished task may unblock dependents or free a slot).

PAUSE CONVERGENCE (any kind:"pause", whether from next-task or next-action):
  Spawn NOTHING new. TaskStop every in-flight agent in the table (safe: the quota gate
  precedes recordResults, and the spawn_in_flight reset makes abandoned spawns
  resume-clean). Then route by scope:
    scope "5h" → IN-SESSION WAIT — do NOT stop the session. A 5h breach self-heals as
        the rising curve lifts the cap (it fully resets by resets_at_epoch, ≤5h, so
        recovery is guaranteed — no cycle cap or wall-budget needed). Report ONCE ("5h
        quota over curve — pausing in-session; window resets at <resets_at_epoch>, the
        rising curve may clear it sooner; the heartbeat re-checks every <TTL>min, no
        action needed"), ensure the heartbeat is armed (CronList; arm per the heartbeat
        block if missing), then WAIT: end the turn. On the next heartbeat (or any
        re-entry) go to REFILL as normal — `factory next-task` re-runs the gate and the
        orchestrator self-clears paused→running on a fresh proceed:
          non-"pause" envelope → recovered; resume THE LOOP (emit one line: "quota
              recovered, resuming").
          "pause" scope "5h"   → WAIT again SILENTLY (do NOT re-report).
          "pause" scope "7d"/"unavailable" → escalate per those branches below.
        The run stays "paused" (a LIVE wait, not terminal) throughout, so the heartbeat
        keeps firing. (The <TTL>min heartbeat stays under the 3600s usage-cache staleness
        ceiling, so the cache never goes stale mid-wait; an operator stallTtlMinutes > 60
        would break that — keep it under.)
    scope "7d" → report scope/reason/resets_at_epoch; STOP — a 7d breach cannot be waited
        out in-session; tell the user to re-run `/factory:resume` after the window resets.
    scope "unavailable" → run `factory resume` ONCE (this turn's own traffic refreshes
        the usage cache): "resumed" → clear the table and REFILL; anything else →
        report + STOP.
```

If `next-action` rejects `--results` as stale/duplicate (result_key mismatch), re-invoke WITHOUT `--results` to get the current envelope and continue — the ONE sanctioned retry (Iron Law 3 applies to everything else).

**Never "help" with merges.** Parallel tasks racing into the same staging branch is
the engine's problem, already bounded engine-side (MergeSerializer + the BEHIND
refusal + `MERGE_RESYNC_CAP`). Never resolve a conflict, rebase a task branch, or
retry a merge yourself — a merge failure surfaces through the envelopes like any
other outcome.

**Run-level stages never overlap tasks.** `finalize`/`e2e`/`e2e-assessment`/`traceability`/`document`/`done`
only emit when the table is empty (the engine emits them only with no drivable task
work). Drive them foreground exactly as written in their stage blocks. If one ever
arrives while the table is non-empty, that is an engine defect — STOP LOUD (Iron Law 3).

**Compaction / context-loss recovery.** Never guess. The table is a cache — rebuild
it: `next-task` re-derives the ready set (in-flight tasks listed first); for each
in-flight task, `next-action` WITHOUT `--results` idempotently re-emits the current
manifest. Before re-spawning, check `TaskList` for still-running agents this session
owns and re-attach them to the table (never double-spawn a producer into a task
worktree); any manifest agent you cannot account for → re-spawn it per the manifest
(abandoned spawns are resume-clean). **Also re-arm the heartbeat** — `CronCreate` jobs
are session-scoped (a compaction that starts a fresh session, or `/factory:resume`,
loses whatever job the prior session armed); `CronList` first to avoid a duplicate if
the same session is merely re-entering after a completion.

**Abandoning a run.** If the user asks to abort/cancel/abandon this run mid-loop, run `factory run cancel --run <run_id>` (defaults to the run THIS session owns, then `runs/current`). It marks the run `failed` via the engine's own writer — so it works even with a task still executing. A cancelled run is terminal and NOT resumable (start a fresh `/factory:run` instead). Add `--cleanup` to also tear down the staging branch + its task PRs (omit it to keep them for manual handling). Cancel is for deliberately DISCARDING a run — you no longer need it merely to stop: the Stop hook lets a session end and leaves the run resumable via `factory resume`. Never edit `state.json` by hand — `run cancel` is the sanctioned abandon verb.

### Collecting a spawn envelope

Write results files under `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/results/<run_id>/` (create the dir). NEVER write under `runs/**` or `specs/**` — the plugin's own TCB hooks deny those writes; `next-action --results` reads from any path. Every spawn envelope names `expects`:

**`expects: "producer-status"`** (stages tests/exec — ONE producer agent):

1. Spawn the producer — `subagent_type` = the manifest agent's `agent_type`
   VERBATIM, model mapped, `maxTurns` OMITTED unless the manifest entry carries
   one (frontmatter governs — see the spawn rule above), **isolation OMITTED**,
   plus the manifest agent's `effort` as the
   spawn's `effort` opt **when present** (the dial sets it only on high escalation
   rungs; omit it otherwise to inherit the default). Prompt = `agents[0].prompt`
   VERBATIM (the engine composes the full ProducerContext + cd-sentence at spawn time).
   The test-writer commits failing tests first (TDD); the implementer commits the
   minimal implementation. They follow `agents/test-writer.md` / `agents/implementer.md`.
2. Capture its terminal STATUS line (`STATUS: DONE` | `STATUS: BLOCKED — escalate` |
   `STATUS: NEEDS_CONTEXT`).
3. Results file: `{ "result_key": <tenv.result_key verbatim>, "producer": { "status": "<line>" } }`.

**`expects: "reviews"`** (stage verify — the review panel, plus sidecar):

1. **Sidecar (if `tenv.sidecar` present):** spawn `sidecar.agent_type` VERBATIM,
   isolation `"worktree"`, model mapped from `sidecar.model`, `maxTurns = sidecar.max_turns`,
   prompt = `sidecar.prompt` VERBATIM — in the background, alongside the panel.
   Keep its raw output.
2. **Panel:** spawn EVERY entry in `manifest.agents` (count-agnostic — the engine appends the
   content-conditional `database-design-reviewer` when the task diff touches migration/schema
   files, Decision 51; each `subagent_type` = the entry's `agent_type` VERBATIM,
   isolation `"worktree"`, model mapped from each agent's `model`,
   `maxTurns` OMITTED — reviewer entries never carry `max_turns`; each
   reviewer's own frontmatter governs). Each prompt: inspect via
   `git -C <tenv.worktree> diff <tenv.base_ref>` and emit ONE RawReview JSON exactly per
   `skills/review-protocol/SKILL.md`'s output contract (injected into every panel
   reviewer via its frontmatter `skills:` — do not restate the shape).

    **Prior dispositions (D67).** When the envelope carries `prior_dispositions`,
    append it VERBATIM to EVERY panel reviewer's prompt (it is the anti-ratcheting
    ledger of claims a prior round refuted or raised non-blocking). NEVER append it
    to a finding-verifier prompt (step 3) — the verifier confirms independently,
    anti-anchoring. The codex cross-vendor prompt already contains it (the engine
    composes it in); do not append it twice there.

    **Cross-vendor quality-reviewer (Δ U/S5).** The manifest carries the engine's
    resolved `cross_vendor` stamp; it decides how the `quality-reviewer` entry runs:
    - `cross_vendor.status == "present"` → do NOT spawn the Claude quality-reviewer.
      Run it via Bash instead, spawning `cross_vendor.prompt` VERBATIM (3b/ii — the
      engine already composed the `agents/quality-reviewer.md` charter + the
      `skills/review-protocol/SKILL.md` contract + the diff-scope pointer; the
      runner supplies only the invariant vendor-exec flags, never reassembles the
      prompt itself):
      `codex exec --model <cross_vendor.model> --sandbox read-only --cd <tenv.worktree> "<cross_vendor.prompt>"`
      Parse the RawReview JSON from stdout (last JSON object). On rc≠0, unparseable
      output, or a wrong-shape verdict: FALL BACK to spawning the Claude
      quality-reviewer as normal AND set
      `crossVendorAbsent: { "reason": "codex execution failed: <rc/parse detail>" }`
      in the results file — the fallback ran same-vendor, and that must stay loud.
    - `cross_vendor.status == "absent"` → spawn the Claude quality-reviewer as
      normal and copy the stamp's `reason` VERBATIM into `crossVendorAbsent`.
    - stamp missing (older engine) → treat as absent with reason
      `"no cross-vendor stamp on manifest"`.

3. **Verify-then-fix:** for EACH finding that is `blocking:true` AND citable, spawn an
   INDEPENDENT finding-verifier using `manifest.verifier_spec` VERBATIM — `agent_type`,
   `model`, `isolation` (3b/iii: no more hardcoded `general-purpose`/`opus`/
   `"worktree"`). Render `verifier_spec.prompt_template` by substituting EXACTLY
   `verifier_spec.interpolate_fields` (today: `{claim, file, line, quote}`). A field is
   admissible iff the verifier can CHECK it against the code — so NEVER pass what the
   reviewer BELIEVED: its `description` (reasoning), its `severity` (confidence), or its
   `reviewer` (identity). Anti-anchoring: the verifier must judge the bare claim against
   the code, not be led toward the finder's prior. Append the worktree/base-ref pointer (`git -C <tenv.worktree> diff
<tenv.base_ref>`) same as every other reviewer. It returns
   `{ "holds": true|false, "note": "<why>" }`.
4. Results file:
    ```json
    { "result_key": <tenv.result_key verbatim>,
      "holdout": { "raw": "<sidecar agent raw output>" },
      "reviews": {
        "reviews": [ <each RawReview JSON> ],
        "verifications": [ { "reviewer":"<role>", "verdicts":[ {"file","line","holds","note"} ] } ],
        "crossVendorAbsent": { "reason": "<the manifest stamp's reason, or the codex runtime-failure detail>" } } }
    ```
    Omit `"holdout"` when there was no sidecar. Include one verdict for every
    blocking+citable finding. **If a finding-verifier returns no parseable JSON,
    OMIT its verdict — never synthesize one.** A missing verdict is the correct
    fail-closed signal: the CLI raises a verifier error and the merge gate blocks.
    A fabricated `holds: false` is read as a genuine refutation, silently drops a
    possibly-real blocker, and leaves no trace in state. **This is the only reason
    to omit a verdict** — a verifier that inspected and is merely unsure returns
    `holds: false` on its own. Include
    `crossVendorAbsent` ONLY when no cross-vendor reviewer actually ran (stamp
    absent, or the `codex exec` fallback fired) — never invent the reason: echo
    the stamp's reason or the runtime-failure detail exactly.

### Agent spawn rule

Every spawn envelope carries `agent_type` — spawn
`Task(subagent_type: <the envelope's agent_type VERBATIM>)` with the entry's
model/max_turns; honor isolation as given (producers and run-level stage agents
say "isolation OMITTED — works IN the envelope's worktree"; panel reviewers say
`"worktree"`). NEVER re-derive the type from `role` or from prose. The
finding-verifier (step 3 above) is spawned from `manifest.verifier_spec`, not
hardcoded — same rule, different field.

`max_turns` is OPTIONAL on a spawn entry — each agent's own frontmatter
(`agents/<agent_type>.md` `maxTurns:`) is the single source of truth. When the
entry omits `max_turns`, spawn with NO turn-budget override at all (let the
agent's frontmatter govern); when present, it's a deliberate engine override —
pass it verbatim.

Model alias mapping: manifest model id contains `haiku` → `haiku`; `sonnet` →
`sonnet`; otherwise → `opus`. The manifest `effort` (when present) is passed to the
spawn **verbatim** — its values (`xhigh`/`max`) already match the spawn `effort` enum,
so no aliasing applies; it appears only on producer spawns, never reviewers.

## Phase 4 — Report

- A `pause` stop is NOT a quality outcome — never finalize it. A `scope "5h"` pause
  does not reach here (it waits in-session — see PAUSE CONVERGENCE); a `scope "7d"`/
  `"unavailable"` pause reports the reset horizon and stops (resume re-enters Phase 3
  via `factory resume`, which clears a recovered checkpoint, then THE LOOP).
- After `run finalize`: `factory score --run <run_id>` +
  `factory state <run_id> --summary`. Surface the run
  status (`completed | failed`), the rollup PR, filed issues, and every
  drop with its class — plainly, never papered over. If the self-heal paged
  (`factory rescue auto` returned `kind:"page"`), include its reason + hints.
- Documentation is no longer a Phase-4 step: the engine runs it as the
  `document` stage in THE LOOP (Phase 3), before finalize ships the rollup.
  On an `--e2e` run, the e2e stage runs before docs (Decision 39) — a failed
  e2e phase skips docs entirely (don't document code the e2e verdict just
  condemned) and is reported alongside the rollup, not as a separate step.
  The PRD-traceability audit (S9, Decision 47) sits between e2e and docs on
  every non-debug run — a failed audit likewise skips docs and blocks the
  rollup (unmet PRD requirements surface in the report + PRD comment).

## When NOT to use this skill

- CLI/internal questions or debugging → regular tools.
- Docs-only change → spawn `scribe` directly.
- A finished run → `factory state`; only a paused/suspended run resumes.
