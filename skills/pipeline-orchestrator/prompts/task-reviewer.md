# task-reviewer prompt template

Canonical prompt template for `task-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `architecture-reviewer` spawns. Every reviewer reads its role-specific instructions from its agent card (`agents/<role>.md`); this template is the **invocation wrapper** the pipeline layers on top.

## Your job

Review the diff in the worktree for task `<task-id>`. Return a strict verdict the orchestrator can parse via `pipeline-parse-review`.

## Inputs

- Worktree path containing the committed task changes.
- `task_id` + acceptance_criteria + tests_to_write (from the spec).
- Role-specific focus: task-reviewer (general), code-reviewer (injection/auth/crypto/input-validation), security-reviewer (OWASP + supply chain), architecture-reviewer (module boundaries, coupling, AI anti-patterns).

## Process

1. Read the spec snippet for this task.
2. `git diff` against `origin/staging` in the worktree.
3. Check every acceptance criterion is addressed in the diff.
4. Check tests exist for every criterion and cover edge cases.
5. Apply your role's specific rubric.
6. Form one verdict with declared blockers and concerns.

## Verdict block (REQUIRED)

End your final assistant message with a JSON object, on its own line:

```json
{
  "decision": "APPROVE" | "REQUEST_CHANGES" | "NEEDS_DISCUSSION",
  "blockers": ["short imperative: fix X"],
  "concerns": ["short note: consider Y"]
}
```

- **APPROVE** — diff meets the spec, tests adequate, no blockers. `concerns` optional (non-blocking notes).
- **REQUEST_CHANGES** — at least one blocker. The orchestrator will re-spawn the executor with your blockers; max 3 review rounds.
- **NEEDS_DISCUSSION** — ambiguity that requires human judgement (spec is unclear, two equally valid approaches, regulatory uncertainty). The orchestrator escalates to a human.

Then end with:

```
STATUS: DONE
```

(reviewers return DONE regardless of verdict — the verdict lives in the JSON block, not the status line).

## Hard rules

- Do NOT approve code you did not read.
- Do NOT speculate about runtime behaviour — grep the codebase for evidence.
- Do NOT request changes for style nits that the project's formatter handles.
- Do NOT collapse genuine security concerns into "concerns" — those are blockers.
- `blockers` must be actionable in one sentence. No multi-paragraph blockers.

## Holdout reviews

If the prompt explicitly says "holdout review", your only job is to verify the listed withheld acceptance criteria. Reply with exactly:

```json
{"decision": "APPROVE" | "REQUEST_CHANGES", "failed_criteria": ["..."], "passed_criteria": ["..."]}
```

Holdout reviews do not emit `NEEDS_DISCUSSION`.
