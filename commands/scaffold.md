# /factory:scaffold

Prepare a project to be run by the factory pipeline. The pipeline **refuses to start**
against an unscaffolded or unprotected repo, so run this before any `/factory:run` in a new
repo. All the work is done by one deterministic CLI call — `factory scaffold` — which copies
the committed CI + gate-config templates, and probes branch protection on `develop` (the
integration base).

## Step 1 — Confirm the checkout

Confirm you are inside a git checkout:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel        # must succeed; else tell the user to run from a checkout and stop
```

`--repo` is **optional**: `factory scaffold` auto-derives `<owner>/<name>` from the `origin`
remote of the current checkout. Pass `--repo <owner/name>` only to override (an explicit value
that disagrees with the origin remote fails loud). If there is no `origin` remote and the user did
not pass `--repo`, the CLI fails loud telling them to pass it.

`gh` is a **hard dependency** — the CLI shells out to it for the protection probe and (with
`--provision`) the protection write. If `gh` is missing, stop with the install hint
(`brew install gh` / your platform's package) and do not proceed.

## Step 2 — Scaffold

```bash
factory scaffold        # --repo is auto-derived from origin; pass --repo <owner/name> to override
```

This is idempotent. It:

- **renders the configured `quality.gateEnv`** (set via
  `factory configure --set quality.gateEnv.<KEY>=<value>`) **into the managed
  `quality-gate.yml`** build step (the `# factory:gate-env` marker becomes a real `env:` block),
  so the committed CI and the factory's local merge gate build with identical env — one config,
  one source of truth. An empty `gateEnv` leaves the marker untouched;
- copies `.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml` (the CI net), and — when the target is a Node
  package — `.stryker.config.json` + `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` (gate configs);
- **refreshes outdated files**: managed CI-net files are overwritten on any drift from the
  shipped template; seed gate configs are overwritten only while PRISTINE — untouched since
  scaffold wrote them, proven via the committed `.factory/scaffold.lock` hash record. A
  customized seed is project-owned and never touched (delete it and re-scaffold to re-adopt
  the latest baseline). Refreshes land in `files_updated`;
- guarantees the `.gitignore` entries that keep factory state un-committed;
- emits (or non-destructively MERGES into) the target repo's `.claude/settings.json` — the
  factory permission allow-list (the `factory` CLI, git/gh, the agent tools, the data dir) plus
  `worktree.baseRef:"head"` — so an interactive `/factory:run` in this repo runs without a
  permission prompt per call. It does **not** write a `statusLine` (that would clobber yours);
  the factory statusline belongs only to the autonomous relaunch (`factory autonomy ensure`).
  Re-running is safe: existing keys (including your own statusLine) are preserved and entries
  are never duplicated;
- probes branch protection on `develop` and **refuses loudly if it is missing**.
  (`develop` is a precondition — scaffold does not create it. Per-run staging branches
  `staging-<run-id>` are minted at `run create`, not here.)

Protection is **two-profile** (Decision 74, default `git.developProtection: "run-scoped"`):
scaffold writes/asserts only the **baseline** — required checks
`git.developBaselineStatusChecks` (default derived: `developRequiredStatusChecks` minus
Mutation Testing → Quality + Security Scan) for non-admin PRs,
no strict up-to-date, `enforce_admins: false` so admins can push develop directly. The
full strict profile (`git.developRequiredStatusChecks`, strict, admins enforced) is
escalated by `run create` and dropped back to baseline when the run ends. With
`git.developProtection: "permanent"` scaffold writes the strict profile once and the
engine never touches it again (the pre-D74 behavior).

Print the emitted `ScaffoldReport` JSON: `files_created`, `files_present`, `files_updated`, and
`protection`.

## Step 3 — Handle a protection refusal

If scaffold refuses because `develop` is unprotected, the run cannot start safely
(serial-writer correctness depends on required-up-to-date protection, Δ A/L). Offer the user
two options:

- **Provision it** (writes the baseline protection on `develop`): re-run with `--provision`.

    ```bash
    factory scaffold --provision        # --repo auto-derived from origin
    ```

- **Protect it manually** in the repo settings (at minimum the baseline required status
  checks; in `permanent` mode also strict "require branches to be up to date"), then
  re-run `factory scaffold`.

Do not proceed against an unprotected repo.

Notes (run-scoped mode): re-running `factory scaffold --provision` is also the **one-shot
migration** for a repo stuck on the old permanent strict profile — it downgrades develop
to the baseline. It refuses while a factory run is active on the repo (it would strip the
escalated profile mid-run).

## Step 4 — Summary

Report:

- Files created by scaffold vs. already present, plus any outdated files auto-refreshed
  (`files_updated`). Remind the user to COMMIT `.factory/scaffold.lock` alongside the seeds.
- Protection on `develop`: enabled / strict-up-to-date / required checks / whether just
  provisioned (in run-scoped mode the healthy at-rest shape is the baseline: the two
  baseline checks, strict off).

Then remind the user:

- Run `/factory:configure` to inspect or change any setting.
- Run `/factory:run --issue <N>` to kick off a pipeline (`--repo` auto-derived from origin).

> The bash-era extras (progress files, `init.sh`, TruffleHog prompt, the `safety.*`
> write-blocklist) are gone: run/spec state lives outside the repo under the data dir, and
> the trusted-compute-base write-deny is now **hardcoded** in the hooks (not config-sourced).
