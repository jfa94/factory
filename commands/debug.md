# /factory:debug

Whole-scope review⇄fix loop: repeatedly review the diff between a base ref and
`HEAD` with the same risk-invariant 4-role panel `/factory:run`'s merge gate uses,
turn confirmed blockers into a synthetic spec, drive it through the ordinary
`factory next-task`/`factory next-action` producer⇄reviewer loop, and repeat until
a pass comes back clean (or `--max-passes` is reached) — then finalize into one PR.

Parse `--base`/`--full` (reject if both are present), `--no-ship`, `--author-e2e`,
`--max-passes <n>` (positive integer), and `--session-id` from the invoking
command's flags. Like `/factory:run`, this requires autonomous mode — the skill
runs `factory autonomy preflight` as its own first step; a non-autonomous session
halts with the printed relaunch command (`claude --settings <merged-settings.json>`).

Then load the skill:

```
Skill(debug, "base=<resolved|omitted> full=<true|false> no-ship=<true|false> author-e2e=<true|false> max-passes=<n|default> session-id=<id|$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID>")
```

All loop logic — the autonomy check, `factory debug start`, the panel spawn +
finding-verifier + review-record cycle, the synthetic-spec sub-loop, `factory debug
seed`, driving the task loop (including the finalize-interception rule — a
mid-session `next-task` `"finalize"` means "re-review", never "call `factory run
finalize`"), and the one real `factory debug finalize` at the end — lives in
`skills/debug/SKILL.md`. Do not duplicate it here.
