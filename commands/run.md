# /dark-factory:run

You are the entry point for the dark-factory autonomous coding pipeline. Parse the user's arguments and orchestrate the pipeline launch.

## Step 1: Check Autonomous Mode

Check if this session has the required safety settings:

```bash
echo "${DARK_FACTORY_AUTONOMOUS_MODE:-}"
```

If `DARK_FACTORY_AUTONOMOUS_MODE` is not `1`, materialize a relaunchable settings file and tell the user how to relaunch:

```bash
# Resolve plugin root from the installed pipeline-state binary
plugin_root=$(dirname "$(dirname "$(which pipeline-state)")")
mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA"

# Materialize an absolute-path copy of the autonomous settings template.
# The template may reference ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} anywhere (top-level hooks,
# matcher groups, command strings, env values). walk() + gsub() substitutes
# every occurrence regardless of nesting. User-env hooks (~/.claude/hooks/*)
# and inline shell snippets are left untouched because they contain no
# ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} token. Running this twice with the same $plugin_root
# is idempotent.
merged_settings="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/merged-settings.json"
jq --arg root "$plugin_root" '
  walk(
    if type == "string" and test("\\$\\{CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT\\}")
    then gsub("\\$\\{CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT\\}"; $root)
    else . end
  )
' "$plugin_root/templates/settings.autonomous.json" \
  > "$merged_settings"

echo "Generated: $merged_settings"
```

Then stop and show the user:

> This pipeline requires autonomous mode settings for safe operation.
>
> Relaunch Claude Code with the generated settings file:
>
> ```
> claude --settings $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/merged-settings.json
> ```
>
> Or set `DARK_FACTORY_AUTONOMOUS_MODE=1` in your environment to acknowledge autonomous operation.

Do not proceed without this confirmation.

## Step 2: Validate Preconditions

Run the project validator:

```bash
pipeline-validate --no-clean-check
```

Use `--no-clean-check` because the pipeline itself will create changes. If validation fails, report the failing checks and stop.

## Step 3: Parse Mode and Arguments

Determine the operating mode from the user's input:

| Mode       | Required Args              | Description                                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `discover` | (none)                     | Find all open issues with [PRD] marker and process them |
| `prd`      | `--issue N`                | Process a single PRD issue                              |
| `task`     | `--task-id T --spec-dir D` | Execute a single task from an existing spec             |
| `resume`   | (none)                     | Resume the most recent interrupted run                  |

Validate that required arguments are present for the chosen mode.

## Step 4: Initialize Run

For modes that create a new run (discover, prd, task):

```bash
pipeline-init "<run-id>" --issue <N> --mode <mode>
```

Generate a run-id from the current timestamp: `run-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`

For `resume` mode, read the existing run state:

```bash
pipeline-state resume-point "$(pipeline-state list | jq -r 'last')"
```

## Step 5: Handle Dry Run

If `--dry-run` was specified:

1. Show the execution plan (mode, issues, tasks to run)
2. Show validation results
3. Do NOT spawn the orchestrator
4. Exit cleanly

## Step 6: Spawn Orchestrator

Spawn the pipeline orchestrator agent with the appropriate context:

```
Agent({
  description: "Run dark-factory pipeline",
  subagent_type: "pipeline-orchestrator",
  prompt: "... mode, run_id, issue numbers, spec path, etc ..."
})
```

Pass all relevant context:

- Run ID
- Mode
- Issue number(s)
- Spec directory (for task mode)
- Task ID (for task mode)
- Resume point (for resume mode)

The orchestrator handles everything from here — spec generation, task execution, review, PR creation, and cleanup.
