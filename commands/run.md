# /factory:run

Start a **fresh** pipeline run. The `factory` CLI is the engine (ALL control flow); the
runner is a dumb loop. `/factory:run` never silently reuses an existing run — to continue
or repair one, use `/factory:resume` (it routes itself). Reject the call
with a clear message if neither or both of `--issue`/`--spec-id` are given. `--repo` is
OPTIONAL — the CLI auto-derives it from the `origin` remote of the current checkout (pass
`--repo <owner/name>` only to override; an explicit value that disagrees with the remote fails
loud).

**Default (no flags): live ship** — the in-session runner loop, auto-merging each task
into staging and the staging→develop rollup into develop. One terse boolean override:
`--no-ship` (open PRs but never merge instead of live).

## Every run starts the same

Load the skill and run its Phases 0–2 (preconditions → spec loop → `factory run create
[--no-ship] [--e2e] [--supersede | --resume] --session-id "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"`;
read `run_id` from the emitted `{kind:"created"|"superseded", run}` envelope). Forward THIS
command's `--no-ship`/`--e2e`/`--supersede`/`--resume`/`--ignore-quota` flags verbatim to Phase 2's `run
create` so the ship intent persists on the run — `ship_mode` is read back by
resume + finalize (never re-passed). `--no-ship`/`--e2e`
are **create-only** selectors: combining either with `--resume` is rejected loud by
`run create` (a resumed run keeps the `ship_mode`/`e2e` it was born with — both immutable), so
never let a ship flag ride a resume hand-off. Always pass `--session-id
"$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID"` so the run records THIS session as its `owner_session` — the Stop
gate then keeps the autonomous loop alive only here and lets other sessions stop freely
(Prompt J). With `--spec-id`, skip Phase 1 — the spec must already exist; `run create` fails
LOUD otherwise. When `--supersede` is set, forward it to Phase 1's `factory spec resolve` call
so the reuse check is skipped — Phase 1 will always regenerate from the PRD in this case
(never reuse); the OLD durable spec survives until `spec store` replaces it after the new
spec passes gate + review. Forward `--ignore-quota` to `spec resolve` too. `--supersede` has
no effect on the spec when combined with `--spec-id` (Phase 1 is skipped).

Forward `--approve-spec` verbatim too. When set, the `created`/`superseded` envelope
carries `spec_approval` and the run is already parked (`suspended`, no quota checkpoint) —
**STOP immediately**: print `spec_approval.spec_path` + "review the spec, then run
`/factory:resume`" and do NOT call `next-task` or enter THE LOOP (its quota-gate step
clears suspensions once it proceeds, which would silently un-park the run). Resume IS the
sign-off (S9, Decision 47).

Three Phase-1 envelopes are terminal — STOP, spawn nothing:

- `{kind:"unspecifiable"}` (exit 1): the PRD cannot support spec generation — relay
  `blockers` verbatim, tell the user to edit the PRD issue and re-run (zero agent cost;
  S9, Decision 47).
- `{kind:"pause"}` (exit 0): quota pacing stopped the spec build BEFORE any apex spend
  (or `--supersede` targeted a weekly-parked run). No run exists yet, nothing is parked —
  report `scope`/`reason`/`resets_at_epoch` (convert to a local time) and tell the user to
  re-run after the reset, or with `--ignore-quota` to override.
- `{kind:"spec-defect"}` (exit 1): the engine exhausted the regen bound
  (`iterations`/`max_iterations`) — relay `reason` + `blockers` verbatim; the PRD needs
  rework.

```

## Active-run conflict (Decision 35 — no silent reuse)

If an active run already exists for this spec, Phase 2's `run create` exits `3`. There are
two distinct conflict envelopes — **handle `kind` first**:

### `kind:"pause"` — weekly quota hard stop

```json
{
    "kind": "pause",
    "scope": "7d",
    "run_id": "…",
    "status": "suspended",
    "reason": "…",
    "resets_at_epoch": 1234567890
}
```

The existing run is parked on the weekly quota window. This is a **hard stop** — do NOT
offer the supersede/resume prompt. Report the `reason` and `resets_at_epoch` (convert to a
human-readable date), tell the user to run `/factory:resume` after the window resets, and
**STOP**. The only override is `--ignore-quota`, which the user must pass explicitly:

```
run re-blocked on the 7d quota window (resets ~<date>).
Run /factory:resume after it resets, or re-run with --ignore-quota to override.
```

### `kind:"exists"` — generic active-run conflict

```json
{"kind": "exists", "existing": {"run_id": "…", "status": "running"}}
```

Unless the user already passed `--supersede`/`--resume` (forwarded by the skill, skipping
the prompt), ask with one `AskUserQuestion` before doing anything destructive:

- **Continue (resume)** → run `/factory:resume --run <existing.run_id>` — re-enter the
  existing run where it left off (its staging branch + merged work are intact).
- **Supersede (fresh)** → re-run `factory run create … --supersede`: the spec is
  regenerated from the PRD (Phase 1 — the old spec is replaced only once the new one
  passes gate + review), the old run is marked `superseded`, its `staging/<run-id>`
  branch + task PRs are deleted, and a fresh run starts with the new spec. Then drive
  the fresh run.
- **Cancel the prompt** → stop here; leave the existing run untouched and `running` (this
  declines to start a fresh run — it does NOT abandon the existing one).

Map the answer to the `--resume` / `--supersede` flag — the CLI stays the single source of
truth (never hand-edit run state from the command).

To genuinely **abandon** the existing run (mark it terminal so its owning session can stop),
that session runs `factory run cancel --run <run_id>` (`--cleanup` also deletes its staging
branch + task PRs). A cancelled run is `failed` and NOT resumable — start fresh with
`/factory:run`. See Decision 35's addendum.

## The loop

Continue with the skill's Phase 3 THE LOOP and Phase 4 verbatim: a parallel event loop
driving up to `maxParallelTasks` tasks in flight (config, default 3 — emitted as
`max_parallel` on the work envelope). Every agent is spawned in this session (agents in
the background, every `factory` call foreground), and the `factory` CLI stays the single
source of control flow.

## Autonomous mode (MANDATORY — no opt-in, no opt-out)

The pipeline runs unattended by design. `factory run create` and `factory resume`
**HALT loud** unless the session is autonomous (`FACTORY_AUTONOMOUS_MODE=1`); there is no
bypass flag. The gate lives in the deterministic engine (`src/autonomy/mode.ts`,
`NotAutonomousError`), so a non-autonomous `/factory:run` cannot start a run — it exits
non-zero with the relaunch instruction rather than degrading to per-tool permission prompts.

`/factory:run` calls `factory autonomy preflight` as its first step (Phase 0 of the
runner skill). Preflight auto-scaffolds the merged settings when needed, so the user's
only manual act is the relaunch itself:

```bash
factory autonomy preflight     # run-entry check: (re)scaffolds when needed, prints the relaunch command,
                               #   exits 0 to proceed / 1 to halt (decides over autonomous? + settings
                               #   present? + plugin vs on-disk version). Never throws on the decision path.
factory autonomy ensure        # manual primitive: always (re)writes merged-settings.json + prints the command
factory autonomy status        # manual primitive: exits 0 if autonomous, 1 if not (add --json for the payload)
```

Preflight regenerates `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/merged-settings.json` (via `ensure`) and halts for a
relaunch when the session is **not autonomous** OR the settings are **stale** (the stamped
`_factoryVersion` differs from the installed plugin), **missing**, or **unstamped**; it proceeds
silently when the settings are already fresh, or when the session is autonomous via a
directly-exported env (the sanctioned CI path). `ensure` merges
`templates/settings.autonomous.json` with the user's `~/.claude/settings.json` (placeholders
substituted, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` baked into `env`, `statusLine` wired to `factory statusline`, the
user's own statusline chained via `FACTORY_ORIGINAL_STATUSLINE`), then prints
`claude --settings <merged-settings.json>`. Relaunching with that command sets
`FACTORY_AUTONOMOUS_MODE=1` and produces a fresh `usage-cache.json` on the first turn, which the
quota pacer reads. The relaunch is irreducible: Claude Code reads settings only at
launch, so a running session can never make _itself_ autonomous — automation covers the scaffold,
never the relaunch.

## Resuming a run → `/factory:resume`

Resuming a paused/suspended run is now its own command — see `/factory:resume [--run <id>]`.
`/factory:run` only ever starts fresh.
