# Configuration Schema

All configuration lives in one Zod schema, `src/config/schema.ts`, where every
field carries a default. `ConfigSchema.parse({})` yields a complete, typed config,
so a missing config file is equivalent to all-defaults. Inspect and edit the
overlay with `factory configure` (see [cli.md](./cli.md)); print the resolved
config with `factory config-defaults`.

Edits are persisted as a **sparse overlay** — only the keys you set are written,
so unset keys continue to track future default changes.

Key paths are dotted (e.g. `quality.holdoutPercent`, `git.stagingBranch`).

## Data dir (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`)

Run/spec state lives OUTSIDE the target repo, under the data dir resolved by
`resolveDataDir()` (`src/config/load.ts`). The canonical dir for this install is:

```
~/.claude/plugins/data/factory-jfa94
```

`factory-<marketplace-id>`, where `jfa94` is this marketplace's id
(`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` `name`). Production callers set it via the
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` env var; if it is unset, state-using commands loud-fail with
a message pointing at the `factory-<your-marketplace-id>` form.

### The foreign-plugin leak (benign, self-corrected)

Another plugin (e.g. `codex`) can set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` to **its own** data dir
(under `~/.claude/plugins/data/`). The source of the leak is outside factory's
control. Factory self-corrects: when `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` points at a foreign
plugin's dir, `resolveDataDir()` derives the canonical `factory-jfa94` dir (from
the cache-install layout, falling back to `marketplace.json`) and uses that
instead — so state is never written into another plugin's dir.

The redirect emits a **single WARN per distinct redirect per process** (keyed on
the `current → corrected` pair; `resolveDataDir()` is called ~20×/command, so the
warn is deduplicated rather than spammed). The message states that another plugin
set the var, that factory auto-redirected to its canonical dir, that no action is
required for correctness, and — if you want to silence it permanently — to set
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` to factory's own `factory-<your-marketplace-id>` dir. The
redirect **behavior** is unconditional and unaffected by the warn rate-limiting.

Why the leak happens, why it is benign, and why the warn repeats across
commands is explained in
[the plugin-data-dir explanation](../explanation/plugin-data-dir.md).

## `quality`

Quality-gate thresholds.

### `gateEnv` — CI-parity placeholders

The deterministic gates run in a **fresh task worktree** with no `.env.local` and no
build-time env injection. A repo whose CI supplies placeholder env vars for the same
build step — e.g. a Next.js static prerender that needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` defined — would
otherwise fail the `build` gate on a missing-env crash, a **false-negative floor**
unrelated to task quality. `quality.gateEnv` closes that gap: its name→value map is
merged over `process.env` into the spawn env of every gate command
(`defaultGateTools(gateEnv)`, `src/verifier/deterministic/tools.ts`, wired from config in
`src/cli/wiring.ts`).

**Setting values.** Mirror your CI build-step env by setting each leaf individually:

```bash
factory configure --set quality.gateEnv.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
factory configure --set quality.gateEnv.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=ci-placeholder
```

The schema requires **string** values whose keys are valid POSIX env names
(`z.record(z.string().regex(/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/), z.string())`) — an explicit "set this var"
with a usable name. A purely numeric value is JSON-coerced to a number at the `--set` boundary
and rejected, so quote it as JSON: `--set quality.gateEnv.PORT='"54321"'`.

**One config, both gates.** `quality.gateEnv` is the single source of truth for build-env parity in
**both** directions: the local merge gate merges it over `process.env` for every gate command, and
`factory scaffold` injects it into the managed `quality-gate.yml` it renders — `injectGateEnvIntoWorkflow`
(`src/ci/inject-gate-env.ts`) replaces the `# factory:gate-env` marker following the rendered build
step with a real `env:` block built from the resolved map. So editing `quality.gateEnv` (then
re-scaffolding) keeps the local gate and the repo's GitHub CI in lockstep; an empty map leaves the
marker untouched, and a re-scaffold is byte-identical (idempotent).

This is **CI parity, not secrets**: these placeholders sit in the sparse config overlay in
plaintext. Never put a real credential here — they exist only so the merge gate
exercises the same build CI does.

## `quota`

The two-window quota pacer.

Each `hourlyThresholds` / `dailyThresholds` element is validated as a percentage in
`[0, 100]`, and the array as a whole must be **non-decreasing** (a later checkpoint may
not cap lower than an earlier one) — an out-of-range or descending value is a loud config
error, never persisted.

The review panel is risk-_invariant_ (Decision 26), so there is no review-depth
dial here. `producerModels` is the only dial the quota router carries.

## `spec`

The spec-build pipeline.

| `dimensionFloor`      | int 0–10 | `5`     | Any rubric dimension scoring `≤` this forces NEEDS_REVISION regardless of total. |
| `maxRegenIterations`  | int >0   | `5`     | Max generate ⇄ review revision iterations before a loud give-up.                 |
| `prdBodyMaxBytes`     | int >0   | `65536` | Max bytes of PRD body retained before truncation.                                |

The Decision-21 apex pin (the model/effort the spec generator AND reviewer run at)
is deliberately **not** a config key: it is an _unconditional_ pin, hard consts in
`src/spec/agents.ts` — invariant by construction.

## `review`

The judgment panel.

| Key                  | Type                | Default | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `model`              | string (optional)   | —       | **Holdout-validator model override only.** The review panel no longer reads this key — each reviewer runs on a fixed **per-role** model ([Decision 64](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-64--per-role-reviewer-model-reverses-the-single-fixed-reviewer-model)). It now only overrides the `general-purpose` holdout-validator sidecar's model (`resolveReviewModel`, consumed at `src/orchestrator/orchestrator.ts`); unset ⇒ the documented fallback. |
| `requireCrossVendor` | `"warn" \| "block"` | `warn`  | Policy when no cross-vendor (Codex) reviewer ran on the advancing verify pass ([Decision 44](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-44--verifier-upgrades-grep-rescue-claim-only-verification-real-cross-vendor)). `warn` records the absence loudly; `block` additionally fails the merge gate so a task cannot ship single-vendor.                                                                                                                         |

Cross-vendor availability is **probed at spawn time** (`codex --version`, memoized),
never inferred from config presence — the engine stamps `cross_vendor` on the verify
spawn manifest and the runner executes the quality-reviewer via `codex exec` when
Codex is present. `requireCrossVendor` only sets the policy for when it is **absent**.
See [verifier.md](../explanation/verifier.md).

> **Recommendation (Decision 61).** The default stays `warn`. Flip to `block` **only

Scaffold protects this branch. Never `main`.                                                                                                                                                           |

The **per-run** branch is `staging-<run-id>` from a hardcoded prefix (`runStagingBranch`, Decision 33) — it does **not** derive from this key. Changing it does not rename per-run branches. |
| `developRequiredStatusChecks` | string[] | `["Quality", "Mutation Testing", "Security Scan"]` | Status checks protection must enforce on **`develop`** (asserted at scaffold; written with `--provision`). Defaults to the three contexts the rendered quality-gate workflow always reports (Decision 53), so the rollup PR cannot merge red.                                                                 |
| `stagingRequiredStatusChecks` | string[] | `[]`                                               | Status checks provisioned onto each **`staging-<run-id>`** branch at run create. Empty by default: the engine's local GateRunner is the primary task-level gate, and a required check here would make every task-PR merge wait on CI wall-clock. Protection itself (strict-up-to-date) is still mandatory.    |
| `provision`                   | boolean  | `false`                                            | Opt-in protection provisioning.

## `e2e`

The run-level end-to-end phase ([Decision 39](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-39--e2e-is-a-run-level-engine-phase-criticality-is-persistence-not-a-tag),
overhauled by [Decision 40](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-40--e2e-overhaul-zero-knowledge-ux-via-assessment-adjudication-and-plain-language)).
All keys are optional/defaulted, so a repo that never passes `--e2e` pays nothing. Every
key below is **actually read** by the runtime at each call site (`src/orchestrator/e2e.ts`,
`src/orchestrator/assessment.ts`, `src/verifier/e2e/runner.ts`) — nothing here is
declared-but-unwired.

**Boot config is resolved, not required (Decision 40 D2/D10).** `startCommand`/`baseURL`
are **optional overrides**. The single source of truth for the boot command + URL is the
repo's `playwright.config.ts`, which the run-start **e2e-assessment** phase resolves and
writes on the first `--e2e` run (`resolveBootConfig` = config override ?? assessment-resolved).
An `--e2e` run no longer requires these keys to be set; instead `factory run create --e2e`
eagerly checks three static prerequisites — `package.json`, a `@playwright/test` dependency,
and a `playwright.config.ts` — and fails loud at create time if any is missing. Set the two
keys only to **override** what the assessment would otherwise resolve.

| Key              | Type              | Default | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `startCommand`   | string (optional) | —       | **Optional override.** Command that boots the target app — for Playwright's `webServer` (test runs) and the e2e-author's live-exploration boot. Unset ⇒ the assessment-resolved value in `playwright.config.ts` is used instead.                       |
| `baseURL`        | URL (optional)    | —       | **Optional override.** Base URL the app serves once `startCommand` is up. Validated as a well-formed URL at config-parse time. Unset ⇒ the assessment-resolved value is used.                                                                          |
| `testDir`        | string            | `e2e`   | Repo-relative directory the **committed critical suite** lives in. Persistence in this directory IS the criticality signal — no `@critical` tag exists. **Schema-locked to `e2e`**: any other value is rejected at config-parse time (see note below). |
| `readyTimeoutMs` | int >0            | `30000` | Max wait for `startCommand` to become ready before the boot is a failure (ms).                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `reopenCap`      | int ≥0            | `2`     | Per-task cap on e2e-triggered reopens. A critical spec still red after this many reopens of its mapped task fails the run outright instead of looping forever.                                                                                         |

To override the assessment-resolved boot config, set either or both keys:

```bash
factory configure --set e2e.startCommand="npm run dev"
factory configure --set e2e.baseURL="http://localhost:3000"
```

> `testDir` is load-bearing beyond config and is therefore **schema-locked to the literal
> `e2e`** — the config parser rejects any other value. The seeded
> `templates/playwright.config.ts` hardcodes `e2e`, and the TCB `e2e-suite` write-guard is
> hardcoded to the same path component; a custom `testDir` would silently diverge from what
> actually runs and gates, so the lock closes that gap rather than leaving it a documented
> limitation. The **target repo's own** `playwright.config.ts` is checked against the same
> literal at run birth (S4): `run create --e2e` refuses a config whose declared `testDir` is
> not `e2e`/`./e2e` (an absent declaration fails closed — Playwright defaults to `tests`,
> outside the write-deny). (There is **no** CI `e2e` job — [Decision 40 D11](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-40--e2e-overhaul-zero-knowledge-ux-via-assessment-adjudication-and-plain-language)
> removed it from `quality-gate.yml`; e2e gating is run-level only.) See
> [Run with end-to-end tests](../guides/run-with-e2e.md).

## Root keys

| ------------------------ | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxConsecutiveFailures` | int >0 | `3`     | **Floor** of the circuit-breaker threshold: the run aborts when cumulative genuine `capability-budget` failures (cascade/wedge fails excluded) reach `max(floor, ceil(0.15 × total tasks))` — big task graphs tolerate proportionally more (≤20 tasks behave as a flat cap of 3; 30 → 5, 40 → 6). The ratio is a module constant, not config. The key keeps its historical name for back-compat.                                               |
| `maxParallelTasks`       | int >0 | `3`     | Max tasks the runner drives in flight at once; emitted to the runner as `max_parallel` on the `work` envelope (the runner reads the envelope, never this file). `1` = sequential.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `stallTtlMinutes`        | int >0 | `20`    | Minutes an in-flight spawn (`spawn_in_flight.spawned_at`) may age before `next-task` flags its task in the `work` envelope's `stale` list. Advisory — a silently-dead agent inside a live session is otherwise never re-driven. The flag tells the runner to abandon the stale spawn and re-drive via `next-action` (see [cli.md](./cli.md#next-task) and [state-model.md](./state-model.md#spawn_in_flight--idempotent-re-spawn-checkpoint)). |

## Retired keys

The following bash-era keys are deliberately **absent** and must not be carried
forward (human-review gates are retired — Decision 5/19; the review-depth axis was
removed — Decision 25): `humanReviewLevel`, `NEEDS_DISCUSSION`, the exit-42 code,
and the per-tier review caps.
