# Hooks Reference

The `factory-hook` dispatcher (`dist/factory-hook.js`, built from `src/hooks/`)
enforces invariants at Claude Code tool-use time, independent of any CLI call.
It is wired into `hooks/hooks.json` and invoked as `factory-hook <name>`. Each
guard is a separate, unit-testable function dispatched from the frozen registry in
`src/hooks/main.ts`.

Like the CLI: no args / `--help` lists the hooks and exits `0`; an unknown hook
exits `2`.

## The guards

| Hook                | Fires on                                    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `secret-guard`      | PreToolUse `Bash`                           | Block a `git commit`/`push` that phases a known secret shape, and deny the redirection bypass forms that would decouple the scanned index/repo from the committed one (see [secret-guard](#secret-guard)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `pipeline-guards`   | PreToolUse `Bash`, `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit` | Three invariants while a run is active: test-writer path scope; nested-shell / hook-bypass denial; ship gating (categorical agent-deny of `gh pr create`/`gh pr merge`). Each arm derives its owning run from its own inputs — never the global pointer (see [Run ownership](#run-ownership)).                                                                                                                             |
| `holdout-guard`     | PreToolUse `Read\|Grep\|Glob`, `Bash`       | Deny reads of the holdout answer-key store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `write-protection`  | PreToolUse `Bash`, `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit` | Deny writes to hardcoded TCB (trusted-computing-base) paths — via the `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit` `file_path`(s) **and** via a `Bash` command's write targets (redirects, `tee`/`cp`/`mv`/`install`, `dd of=`, `sed`/`perl -i`, `truncate`, `rm`).                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `subagent-stop`     | SubagentStop                                | Log a stopping reviewer's parsed verdict (observational — the runner record is the single writer of `task.reviewers[]`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `notification`      | Notification                                | Append permission-request notifications to the active run's `metrics.jsonl` as `permission.requested`; ignore idle/non-permission notices and never block the session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `stop-gate`         | Stop                                        | Pass-through + resumability hint. NEVER finalizes and performs NO state mutation; an owned, all-terminal run is left `running` (with a log hint) so the next `factory resume` routes it through the real `finalizeRun`. Blocks ONLY on an inaccessible data directory. Never blocks a session end with pending work — the run stays resumable via `factory resume`.                                                        |
| `session-start`     | SessionStart (`compact`)                    | Re-inject the runner's Iron Laws + a pointer to reload `skills/pipeline-runner/SKILL.md`. A mid-run **compaction** can drop the runner's protocol from conversation context; this emits an `additionalContext` reminder so a compacted session never loses the pointer. Reads no state (the reminder is static). **Registered but not yet wired** — see [SessionStart wiring is pending](#sessionstart-wiring-is-pending). |

## `hooks.json` wiring

Eight guards are wired across six matcher entries (some guards run under more
than one matcher). The `session-start` hook is **registered but not yet wired** (see
[below](#sessionstart-wiring-is-pending)):

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph PreToolUse
    Bash["matcher: ^Bash$"] --> wpB[write-protection]
    Bash --> bp[branch-protection]
    Bash --> sg[secret-guard]
    Bash --> pg1[pipeline-guards]
    Bash --> hg1[holdout-guard]
    EWM["matcher: ^(Edit|Write|MultiEdit)$"] --> wp[write-protection]
    EWM --> pg2[pipeline-guards]

  end
  Stop["Stop"] --> stop[stop-gate]
  SubagentStop["SubagentStop"] --> ss[subagent-stop]
  Notification["Notification"] --> notification[notification]
```

Each entry carries a timeout (5–15s) and a status message. The full mapping is in
`hooks/hooks.json`.

The Notification handler is deliberately observational and fail-quiet: malformed
payloads, missing active runs, and telemetry I/O failures all exit `0`. It maps the
payload `session_id` into owner-scoped run resolution before falling back to cwd,
preventing permission events from being attributed to a concurrent run.

### SessionStart wiring is pending

The `session-start` hook (`src/hooks/session-start.ts`) is implemented, bundled into
`dist/factory-hook.js`, and dispatchable from the registry — but `hooks/hooks.json`
does **not** yet carry a `SessionStart` matcher entry (with `matcher:"compact"`), so
it does not fire in production. `hooks/**` is TCB-protected (the `write-protection`
guard denies edits to it), so the engine cannot self-wire the block; it must be added
by hand. Until then the compaction re-injection is dormant. See the "Known gaps"
section of `CLAUDE.md`.

## Fail-closed posture

The guards fail **closed**: a write whose target sits inside a run worktree but
whose run/task state is missing or broken is treated as deny, never silently
allowed. The `pipeline-guards` ship arm is a categorical boundary — PRs are opened
and merged ONLY by the engine (a `child_process` `gh` call inside `factory next-action`
that never transits this Bash-tool hook), so any `gh pr create`/`gh pr merge`
reaching the hook is an agent-initiated attempt and is unconditionally denied while
a run is active. The merge gate that actually gates shipping is derived from
fresh ground truth _inside the engine_ (derive-don't-store) — there is structurally
no stored `*_gate` boolean to forge (see
[../explanation/derive-dont-store.md](../explanation/derive-dont-store.md)).

The `pipeline-guards`, `holdout-guard`, and the run-scoped checks act only when
they can resolve an owning run from their own inputs (below); otherwise they pass
through — so enabling the plugin in an unrelated session never leaks a live run's
scope into it.

## Run ownership

No hook reads a shared mutable global pointer — none exists (the global
`runs/current` was retired, [Decision 61](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-61--closing-the-outer-quality-loop-review-misses-reviewer-value-single-pointer)).
Each guard **derives the run it belongs to from the signal it already holds**
(Decision 30), so runs across different repos run concurrently without
cross-contamination:

- **Write-scope arm** (`pipeline-guards`, `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit`): derives
  `{run_id, task_id}` from the **absolute target path**. A producer writes into
  `<repo-root>/.claude/worktrees/<run_id>/<task_id>/…`, so the path encodes both ids
  ([Decision 67](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-67--task-worktrees--results-relocate-into-the-target-repos-claudeworktrees)). A
  target under no worktree is not a producer write → pass through; a target under
  a worktree whose run/task state is missing or corrupt → deny (fail closed).
  The worktrees root is a **required, git-derived anchor** — `<main-worktree-root>/.claude/worktrees`,
  derived from the git common dir and resolved once in `loadCliDeps` as `workDir` — never an
  unanchored `.claude/worktrees/` segment scan: this arm fires on every `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`
  system-wide, and `.claude/worktrees/` is also where Claude Code's own native worktree feature
  puts unrelated worktrees in any repo.
- **Bash arms** (nested-shell, ship): resolve the active run via
  [`loadOwnerScopedRun`](#active-run-resolution) — the owning session's run when
  `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is set, else the cwd repo's current run, else the
  newest non-terminal run. No active run → pass through (these arms are
  lower-stakes — the nested-shell arm is a rail, the ship arm is dormant in
  production).
- **`stop-gate`**: resolves the run owned by the **stopping session**
  (`findActiveByOwner`) rather than the global pointer, so a clobber can't make it
  attribute the hint to the wrong run. When the stopping session owns no single active
  run — no active run, an unknown session, or an ambiguous ≥2-owned set — it passes
  through (allow), logging the pass-through. It **never** finalizes and **never** mutates
  state: an owned, all-terminal run is left `running` with a log hint, and the next
  `factory resume` re-derives all-terminal and routes through the real `finalizeRun`
  (a state-only status flip would bypass the rollup PR, PRD close, and e2e-failed
  override — see [`stop-gate`](#the-guards)).
- **`subagent-stop`**: attributes a stopping reviewer's verdict to the run owned
  by its own session (`findActiveByOwner`); no owned run → the result is skipped
  (it is observational, never authoritative).
- **`holdout-guard`**: run-independent (reads only `dataDir`) — correctly global.

Because `factory run create` **requires** an owning session id
(`--session-id` or `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` — always, no exemption since
Decision 42), an ownerless run never arises in normal operation. The stop-gate's
owner check is therefore belt-and-suspenders for unusual paths rather than a
routine code path.

The write-scope arm is a **rail**, not the boundary: the authoritative TDD
enforcement is the deterministic commit-order gate on the task branch
(`src/verifier/deterministic/strategies/tdd.ts`), so a path-anchor miss (e.g. a
producer write issued via `Bash`) does not weaken enforcement.

### Active run resolution

The Bash arms (and the statusline tick) resolve "which run is active" via
`loadOwnerScopedRun` (`src/hooks/hook-context.ts`) in a strict 3-tier order. The
global repo-less `runs/current` pointer is **retired**
([Decision 61](../explanation/decisions.md#decision-61--closing-the-outer-quality-loop-review-misses-reviewer-value-single-pointer)),
so there is no last-writer-wins fallback to race:

1. **Owner session** — `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` set → the run THAT session owns
   (`findActiveByOwner`); `null` if none, so a concurrent run owned by another
   session is never inherited.
2. **CWD repo** — no session id but a cwd → the cwd repo's per-repo current
   pointer (`resolveRepo` → `readCurrentForRepo`). An underivable repo (not a
   checkout / no `origin`, a `UsageError`) falls through; any other resolution
   failure surfaces LOUD.
3. **Scan** — neither → the newest non-terminal run (`listRuns`). Deliberately
   broader than the old global pointer: the deny arms only need "a run is
   active", and returning `null` in a degraded env would silently re-open the
   ship / nested-shell gates.

Corruption stays loud at every tier — a corrupt `state.json` behind a live
pointer throws (the guard pipeline maps it to a fail-closed deny); only genuine
absence resolves to `null`.

## write-protection (TCB)

`write-protection` denies writes to the **trusted-computing-base** (TCB) — the paths
whose contents control the boundary itself. It fires on both the file-editing tools
(`Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`, checking every `file_path`) and on `Bash` (checking the
command's extracted write targets), so a redirect or coreutil write cannot slip past a
guard that only watched the edit tools. The category enum (`TcbCategory`,
`src/types/tcb.ts`) is **closed**; adding one is a deliberate design change. The
protected set:

| Category        | Path                                              | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

When the data dir is unresolved, the out-of-repo rules fall back to component-anchored
matching (`runs`/`holdouts`/`reviews`) as defense-in-depth. TCB write-protection is
the guard layer; the engine's own `factory` CLI writes bypass it (the hook guards
`Edit`/`Write`/`Bash` tool inputs, not the engine's fs writes — the CLI is the
sanctioned writer).

### The `Bash` arm

A `Bash` command can write a file without ever touching an edit tool, so
`write-protection` also parses each `Bash` command for **write targets** and denies any
that canonicalizes to a TCB path (same denylist, same category messages). The extractor
(`bashWriteTargets`, `src/hooks/write-protection.ts`) is a token-level heuristic, not a
full shell parser; it covers the common file-writing forms:

- **Output-redirection RHS** — `>`, `>>`, `>|`, `2>`, `&>` (scanned across the whole
  command so a redirect inside `$(…)` still counts; fd-dups like `>&1` and process
  substitution `>(cmd)` are excluded).
- **Writing-binary destinations** — `tee`, `cp`/`mv`/`install` (last positional +
  `-t`/`--target-directory`), `dd of=`, `sed`/`perl -i` (in-place), `truncate`, and
  `rm`/`unlink` (deleting a gate config neutralizes it as surely as rewriting it).

Env-prefixes (`VAR=…`) and pass-through wrappers (`sudo`, `env`, `xargs`, …) are skipped
when locating a segment's binary. Exotic quoting or nested-shell forms that evade the
heuristic are already denied by the `pipeline-guards` nested-shell / hook-bypass arm.

## secret-guard

`secret-guard` fires on every `Bash` (autonomous **and** human sessions). It
detects `git commit` / `git push`, resolves the target repo, scans the staged
(`git diff --cached`) or unpushed (`git log -p`) diff for known secret shapes, and
denies on a match.

#### Token-aware commit/push detection

Detection is **token-aware and per-segment**, not a substring match. The command
is split into coarse shell segments and each is parsed with the canonical
`parseGitInvocation` parser (`src/hooks/git-args.ts`); a segment counts as
commit/push **only when that is its real git subcommand**. This avoids the false
positives an earlier substring regex produced — the word `commit`/`push` appearing
inside an `echo` argument, a path, or across a `&&` no longer trips the guard
(e.g. `… && echo "commit needed"` is treated as read-only), while a real commit or
push in a **later** chained segment (`git status && git commit`) is still caught.

The segment splitter is **detection-only** and fails **closed**: over-splitting is
harmless (a fragment still re-parses to its subcommand), and under-splitting is the
only failure that would matter. It therefore breaks on every boundary a hidden
`git commit`/`push` could sit behind:

- sequencing / pipe operators: `&&`, `||`, `;`, a lone `&` (background), `|`,
  newline;
- command-substitution and backtick boundaries: `$(`, `` ` ``, `)`.

So a `git commit`/`push` hidden inside `$(…)`, inside backticks, or after a
background `&` is parsed in its own segment rather than being concealed by the
surrounding command.

A **fail-closed backstop** covers the case where a value-taking pre-subcommand
global makes the parser misread the value as the subcommand (e.g.
`git --namespace x commit`, where `x` is read as the subcommand): a segment that
carries a `git` binary plus a later bare `commit`/`push` token the parser could not
classify is still treated as that op. Over-detection here is acceptable; a missed
detection would be a guard bypass.

Before it scans, it denies — **fail-closed** — the redirection bypasses that would
decouple the index/repo it scans from the one actually committed, so a staged
secret could otherwise slip past:

| `git_diff_failed` / `git_log_failed` | The staged-diff / unpushed-log scan could not be produced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The env-prefix deny is **not** a blanket `GIT_*` block: benign overrides
(`GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*`, `GIT_EDITOR`, `GIT_PAGER`, …)
are explicitly allowed, so a human's `GIT_SSH_COMMAND=… git push` is not a false
positive. Only the listed family redirects the index/object store and is denied.

Unlike target-repo resolution (which uses the parse of the matched commit/push
segment), the redirect-env deny scans the **whole command**, because a redirect var
exported in a **prior** chained segment is still in scope for the later git
process. So `export GIT_INDEX_FILE=… && git commit` is denied even though the
`export` and the `git commit` land in different segments — scoping the scan to the
committing segment alone would fail **open**.

Target-repo resolution honors `git -C <dir>` with **last-wins** semantics (via the
canonical `parseGitInvocation` parser), so a `git -C <clean> -C <secret> commit`
that points the scan at one directory and the commit at another cannot evade the
guard — the scan tracks the same directory the commit uses.

### What the path blocklist blocks (and what it allows)

The guard blocks committing files whose **basename** matches a path blocklist
(e.g. `.env`, key/credential file shapes). Two carve-outs prevent false
positives on files that are committed by convention:

- **Conventionally-committed env files** — basenames matching
  `^\.env\.(example|sample|template|test)$` are skipped by the path blocklist.
  These are placeholders / public dev config that projects commit on purpose.
  Their **content is still scanned**, so a real provider key pasted into a
  `.env.example` is still blocked. The safe set is a fixed regex in
  `src/hooks/secret-guard.ts`; widen it there if a project needs more suffixes.

### Known public tokens (false-positive suppression)

Some published tokens are secret-shaped but are documented, public non-secrets —
most notably the Supabase CLI **local-dev JWTs** (`anon` and `service_role`),
which are signed with the published default JWT secret and carry
`iss: supabase-demo`. Committing these is legitimate.

Before content scanning, `detectSecrets` (`src/shared/secret-patterns.ts`)
**strips every known public token** (`KNOWN_PUBLIC_TOKENS`) from the input, so
they never trip the `jwt` pattern. A real, non-default JWT of the same shape is
left intact and still triggers detection. The known-token list is assembled at
runtime from `[header, payload, signature]` tuples so the source file itself
carries no committed JWT-shaped string. A garbled entry fails **closed** — it
simply stops matching, so the token is scanned like any other and still blocks;
it can never open a hole.
