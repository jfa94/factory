# Dark Factory Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that converts GitHub PRD (Product Requirements Document) issues into merged pull requests with minimal human intervention. The plugin implements a 9-phase autonomous coding pipeline with quality-first review gates and adversarial code review.

## What Problem It Solves

The plugin automates the end-to-end software development workflow: reading a requirements document, generating a specification, decomposing work into tasks, implementing code, writing tests, reviewing changes adversarially, and creating pull requests. Human touchpoints are explicit and configurable rather than required at every step.

## Design Philosophy

**Deterministic-first architecture.** The plugin maintains a 3.5:1 ratio of deterministic components (bin scripts, hooks) to non-deterministic (agents). Agent instructions are followed approximately 70% of the time; hooks and scripts enforce at 100%. This hybrid approach uses agents for judgment tasks (code generation, review) while delegating all validation, state management, classification, and parsing to shell scripts.

**Quality over speed.** Every task output passes through a 5-layer quality gate stack (static analysis, tests, coverage regression, holdout validation, mutation testing) and multi-round adversarial code review before reaching a pull request.

**Resumable execution.** All state is persisted to JSON files. Interrupted runs recover from the last checkpoint via `/factory:run resume`.
