# Dark Factory Plugin

The Dark Factory is a Claude Code plugin that converts a GitHub PRD (Product
Requirements Document) issue into merged pull requests, autonomously, through a
quality-first, TDD-enforced phase machine. A person writes the requirements and
walks away; the factory generates a spec, decomposes it into a dependency graph
of tasks, drives each task test-first through implementation and an adversarial
merge gate, and ships the result up a per-run `staging-<run-id> → develop`
integration branch — only once the whole PRD is delivered, never touching `main`.

## What problem it solves

Autonomous coding agents are unreliable narrators: an agent that says "done"
followed its instructions roughly 70% of the time. The Dark Factory's answer is
to push every decision that _can_ be deterministic out of the agent and into
code, leaving the agents to do only what requires judgment (generate a spec,
write code, review code). The result is a pipeline where phase transitions,
failure classification, the retry ladder, automated gates, and the merge gate are
all enforced by a tested TypeScript engine — not by prose an agent may ignore.

## Design philosophy

**Model A — one engine, one seam, one thin runner.** The plugin is two halves
with a hard seam between them:

- A **deterministic engine**: one Node + TypeScript CLI, `factory <subcommand>`,
  that owns _all_ run-state writes, the spec gates, the deterministic verifier
  gates, failure classification, the producer escalation ladder, the
  risk-invariant merge gate, PR creation — and the pipeline loop itself, exposed
  through ONE seam, the **orchestrator** (`factory next-task` + `factory next-action`). It is pure,
  tested, and **never spawns an agent**.
- A thin **runner**: it steps the seam — spawning exactly the `Agent()`s the
  orchestrator's spawn request names and feeding their raw output back via `factory next-action
--results`. It carries no pipeline logic and never decides a transition by prose.
  ONE runner steps the seam (Decision 42): the in-session parallel event loop
  (`skills/pipeline-runner/SKILL.md`) — every `factory` call foreground, up to
  `maxParallelTasks` tasks' agents in the background.

The CLI subcommands are **reporters** (read-only; emit one JSON envelope), the
**orchestrator** (`next-task` / `next-action` — the control-flow seam), or **writers** (single-step
state mutations). The CLI is the brain and owns the loop; a runner is just the
hands.

**Quality over speed.** Every task is produced test-first (a `test-writer`
commits failing tests, then a `implementer` commits the minimal
implementation — enforced by the TDD gate), passes a stack of deterministic
automated gates (tests, coverage, mutation, SAST, type, lint, build, and the TDD
gate itself), and clears a unanimous four-reviewer adversarial panel — plus a
conditional schema specialist when the diff touches the database — before it can
ship. Reviewer findings are independently confirmed before they act
(verify-then-fix).

**Derive, don't store.** The run state file holds no gate pass/fail booleans.
Every verdict is re-derived from ground truth at the moment it is needed, so
there is structurally nothing in state for an agent to forge.

**Loud, classified failure.** Nothing fails silently. When a task cannot be made
to meet the bar, it is _failed_ with a closed-enum failure class and a
human-facing reason. Because `develop` receives only whole PRDs, any fail makes
the run `failed`: `develop` is left untouched, the PRD stays open, and one comment
listing every failed task is posted on the PRD issue. A `failed` run is a legible,
classified outcome — never a quiet success.

## Architecture at a glance

| Layer             | Lives in                                                            | Role                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Runner surface    | `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/` (markdown)                        | LLM instructions + agent definitions           |
| Deterministic CLI | `src/` → `dist/factory.js` (via `bin/factory`)                      | The engine: orchestrator + reporters + writers |
| Hook guards       | `src/hooks/` → `dist/factory-hook.js` (wired in `hooks/hooks.json`) | Enforce invariants at tool-use time            |
| Run / spec state  | `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/{runs,specs}/`                                 | Lives **outside** the target repo              |

## Who it is for

Engineers operating the factory against their own repositories, and contributors
working on the plugin's TypeScript engine. The [getting-started](./getting-started.md)
tutorial onboards a contributor end-to-end; the [guides](./guides/) solve
operator tasks; the [reference](./reference/) is the precise CLI / config / state
contract.
