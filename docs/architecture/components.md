## Commands

### `/factory:run`

Entry point for all pipeline invocations.

**Arguments:**

| Argument     | Required        | Default    | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `mode`       | No              | `discover` | Operating mode: `discover`, `prd`, `task`, `resume` |
| `--issue`    | For `prd` mode  | -          | GitHub issue number                                 |
| `--task-id`  | For `task` mode | -          | Task ID to execute                                  |
| `--spec-dir` | For `task` mode | -          | Path to spec directory                              |
| `--strict`   | No              | -          | Require [PRD] marker on issues                      |
| `--dry-run`  | No              | -          | Validate without executing                          |

**Behavior:**

1. Check `FACTORY_AUTONOMOUS_MODE` environment variable
2. Run `pipeline-validate` to check preconditions
3. Parse mode and validate arguments
4. Initialize run state via `pipeline-init`
5. Create a dedicated orchestrator worktree at `.claude/worktrees/orchestrator-<run_id>/` and run the full orchestration inline in the invoking session — spec generation, task execution, adversarial review, PR creation, and cleanup. The command itself is the control loop; sub-agents (`spec-generator`, `task-executor`, reviewers, `scribe`) are spawned via `Agent()` with `isolation: worktree` from the main session.

### `/factory:configure`

Conversational settings editor.

**Behavior:**

1. Load current config from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json`
2. Load defaults from `plugin.json`
3. Present settings grouped by category
4. Validate and apply changes
5. Validate changes against schema

---

## Agents

### Orchestrator (main session via `commands/run.md`)

The orchestrator is not a sub-agent — it is the main Claude Code session that invoked `/factory:run`. The command body at `commands/run.md` encodes the full control loop: DAG iteration, sub-agent spawning, retry logic, review rounds, and human escalation.

**Why main-session, not sub-agent?** Claude Code only exposes the `Agent` tool to the top-level session. A sub-agent cannot itself spawn further sub-agents, so an orchestrator-as-agent deadlocks the first time it needs to dispatch a `spec-generator` or `task-executor`.

**Isolation.** Step 6a of `commands/run.md` creates a dedicated worktree at `.claude/worktrees/orchestrator-<run_id>/` and runs every orchestrator git operation inside it. The user's primary checkout is never touched. Sub-agents (`spec-generator`, `task-executor`, reviewers, `scribe`) continue to run with `isolation: worktree` as before.

**Key behaviors:**

- Delegates all deterministic work to `bin/pipeline-*` scripts
- Makes judgment calls: retry vs skip, escalate vs continue
- Spawns concurrent task-executors via multiple `Agent()` calls in one assistant message
- Manages review rounds and human escalation

### spec-generator

Converts a PRD issue body into a spec directory with `spec.md` and `tasks.json`.

| Max Turns | 60          |
| Isolation | worktree    |
| Skills    | prd-to-spec |

**Key behaviors:**

- Skips step 5 (user quiz) in autonomous mode
- Validates output via `pipeline-validate-spec`
- Spawns `spec-reviewer` for quality validation
- Completes handoff protocol to transfer spec across worktree boundary

### task-executor

### architecture-reviewer

Validates architectural compliance: module boundaries, dependency direction, coupling metrics, AI-specific anti-patterns.

| Property       | Value                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Model          | sonnet                 |

| Tools          | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob |
| permissionMode | plan (read-only)       |

**Key behaviors:**

- Checks dependency-cruiser / eslint-plugin-boundaries rules if configured; falls back to manual import-graph scan
- Detects god objects (>300 lines or >15 exports), circular imports, leaky abstractions

| Tools          | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash |
| permissionMode | plan (read-only)       |

**Key behaviors:**

- Traces all user-input sources to sinks (SQL, HTML, shell, file paths, redirects)
- Checks auth/authz: IDOR prevention, ownership verification, RLS (if Supabase), JWT validation
- Scans for hardcoded secrets using pattern + Shannon-entropy analysis
- Verifies new dependencies exist (no typosquatting, no hallucinated subpath imports)
- Checks AI-specific insecure defaults: wildcard CORS, Math.random() for crypto, disabled TLS, missing rate limits
- Spawned for security-tier tasks only

### test-writer

Writes behavioral tests from specifications and type signatures, never from implementation. Kills mutation testing survivors.

| Property  | Value                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Model     | opus                                |
| Max Turns | 30                                  |
| Tools     | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob |

**Key behaviors:**

- Derives expected values from specs, type signatures, and JSDoc — never from reading implementation
- Writes AAA-structured tests with specific value assertions (no tautological or presence-only assertions)
- Writes property-based tests (fast-check) for pure functions and data transformations
- In Phase 5: receives Stryker surviving-mutants report, writes targeted tests to kill each survivor
- Spawned by orchestrator when mutation score < `quality.mutationScoreTarget`

### scribe

Incrementally updates `/docs` after each pipeline run using the Diátaxis framework.

| Property | Value                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Model    | claude-opus-4-5                     |
| Tools    | Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit |

**Key behaviors:**

- Reads `<!-- last-documented: <hash> -->` from the first line of `docs/README.md` to determine which commits are new
- Runs `git diff <hash>..HEAD --name-only` and scopes updates to changed files and their dependents
- Produces only sections it can fill accurately — never speculates or creates placeholders
- Rewrites the last-documented marker to current HEAD on completion
- Spawned as the final enforced step of every pipeline run, before `pipeline-cleanup`

### spec-reviewer

Validates spec output before task execution begins.

| Property  | Value            |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Model     | sonnet           |
| Max Turns | 20               |
| Tools     | Read, Grep, Glob |

**Key behaviors:**

- Reviews with fresh context — did not write the spec
- Scores across 6 dimensions: granularity, deps, criteria, tests, vertical slices, alignment
- Returns structured PASS/NEEDS_REVISION verdict (score >= 54/60 required)
- Spawned by spec-generator; failure triggers regeneration (max 5 iterations)

### quality-reviewer

Fresh-context code review with semi-formal reasoning and structured findings.

| Property  | Value            |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Model     | sonnet           |
| Max Turns | 25               |
| Skills    | review-protocol  |
| Tools     | Read, Grep, Glob |

**Key behaviors:**

- Reviews cold (zero implementation context)
- Uses evidence-first grounding: every finding quotes the code
- Signal-over-noise filtering: scores likelihood × impact, drops low-signal findings
- Output is structured and parseable by `pipeline-parse-review`
- Spawned for security-tier tasks alongside implementation-reviewer

---

## Skills

### review-protocol

Injects Actor-Critic adversarial review methodology into any reviewer.

**Checklist:**

- Correctness: edge cases, error paths, return types
- Security: OWASP Top 10, input validation, secrets exposure
- Test quality: meaningful assertions, failure mode coverage
- AI anti-patterns: hallucinated APIs, over-abstraction, copy-paste drift, dead code, tautological tests
- Performance: algorithmic complexity, missing pagination, memory leaks

**Verdict rules:**

- `APPROVE`: Zero blocking findings AND all acceptance criteria pass
- `REQUEST_CHANGES`: Any blocking finding OR any criterion fails
- `NEEDS_DISCUSSION`: Ambiguity requiring human judgment

---

## Hooks

Defined in `hooks/hooks.json`. All hooks fire for all plugin agents.

### branch-protection (PreToolUse)

Blocks destructive git operations on protected branches (main, master, develop).

**Blocked operations:**

- Push to protected branch (direct or via refspec)
- Force push to protected branch
- Delete protected branch (local or remote)
- Hard reset to protected branch

**Exit codes:**

- 0: Allow operation
- 2: Block operation (JSON reason on stderr)

### run-tracker (PostToolUse)

Append-only audit logging during active pipeline runs.

**Triggers:** Bash, Write, Edit tool uses

**Writes to:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs/<run-id>/audit.jsonl`

**Tamper-evidence:** Each entry includes SHA256 hash chain linking to previous entry. Reordering or deletion is detectable via `--verify` mode.

### stop-gate (Stop)

Validates state consistency when agent session ends.

**Behavior:**

- Checks for incomplete state transitions
- Marks interrupted runs in state
- Removes `runs/current` symlink on clean exit

### subagent-stop-gate (SubagentStop)

Validates subagent artifacts on completion.

**Behavior:**

- Verifies expected output files exist
- Records completion status in parent state

## Metrics

Pipeline execution metrics are written to `$run_dir/metrics.jsonl` (one JSONL line per event) by the `log_metric` helper in `bin/pipeline-lib.sh`. Every event carries `ts`, `run_id`, and `event` fields plus optional key-value pairs. Events of note: `run.start`, `run.summary`, `task.start`, `task.end`, `task.executor_spawned`, `task.gate.quality`, `task.gate.coverage`, `task.coverage.snapshot`, `task.review.provider`, `task.pr_created`, `pipeline.step.begin/end`, `quota.check`, `quota.wait`, `circuit_breaker`. The scorer (`bin/pipeline-score`) reads this file to derive run quality scores.

The MCP metrics server (`servers/pipeline-metrics/`) was removed in version 0.3.5 as it was orphaned and unused. Metrics are now written directly to JSONL files.
