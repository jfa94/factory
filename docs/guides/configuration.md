# Configuring Settings

This guide covers how to adjust pipeline behavior via `/factory:configure` and when to change each setting.

## Accessing Configuration

Run the interactive configuration command:

```
/factory:configure
```

The command:

1. Loads current settings from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.json`
2. Loads defaults from `plugin.json`
3. Presents settings grouped by category
4. Validates changes before applying

Settings persist across sessions.

## Pipeline Behavior

### maxRuntimeMinutes

**Default:** 0 (unlimited) | **Range:** 0-1440

Maximum pipeline runtime before the circuit breaker trips. `0` disables the wall-clock cap entirely.

**When to change:**

- Set a positive value (e.g., 480) as an emergency brake on cost for unattended runs
- Leave at 0 to let the pipeline run until all tasks complete

### maxConsecutiveFailures

**Default:** 5 | **Range:** 1-10

Consecutive task failures before the pipeline aborts.

**When to change:**

- Increase if failures are environmental (flaky tests, network issues)
- Decrease for production repos where failures indicate real problems

### humanReviewLevel

**Default:** 0 | **Range:** 0-4

Controls human oversight checkpoints. Default (0) assumes CI branch protection and GitHub auto-merge are enabled — the pipeline creates a PR and enables auto-merge; CI acts as the merge gate.

| Level | Name              | Behavior                                             |
| ----- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Full Autonomy     | Pipeline creates PR and enables auto-merge (default) |
| 1     | PR Approval       | Pipeline creates PR, human merges                    |
| 2     | Review Checkpoint | Human signs off before PR creation                   |
| 3     | Spec Approval     | Human approves spec before execution                 |
| 4     | Full Supervision  | Human approves at every stage                        |

**When to change:**

- Use 0 (default) for repos with CI branch protection and auto-merge enabled
- Use 1 if CI or auto-merge is not configured
- Use 3-4 for first runs or security-sensitive work

### maxParallelTasks

**Default:** 3 | **Range:** 1-10

Maximum concurrent task-executor agents.

**When to change:**

- Increase to speed up independent task execution
- Decrease if hitting memory limits or API rate limits

---

## Code Review

### review.routineRounds / featureRounds / securityRounds

Maximum adversarial review rounds by risk tier.

| Tier     | Default | Range |
| -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Routine  | 2       | 1-5   |
| Feature  | 4       | 1-10  |
| Security | 6       | 1-10  |

**When to change:**

- Increase for codebases with complex review requirements
- Decrease to reduce API costs on low-risk changes

### review.preferCodex

**Default:** true

Use OpenAI Codex for adversarial review when available, fall back to Claude Code `task-reviewer` otherwise.

**When to change:**

- Set false if Codex is unavailable or you prefer Claude Code review
- Keep true for Codex's purpose-built adversarial review mode

---

## Quality Gates

### quality.holdoutPercent

**Default:** 20 | **Range:** 0-50

Percentage of acceptance criteria withheld from task-executor for holdout validation.

**When to change:**

- Increase (30-40%) for complex specs where surface-level implementation is a risk
- Set to 0 to disable holdout validation entirely

### quality.holdoutPassRate

**Default:** 80 | **Range:** 50-100

Minimum percentage of withheld criteria that must be satisfied without being explicitly requested.

**When to change:**

- Decrease (70%) if holdout failures are frequent but implementations are correct
- Increase (90%) for critical paths where spec adherence is essential

### quality.mutationScoreTarget

**Default:** 80 | **Range:** 50-100

Minimum mutation score percentage for feature and security tier tasks.

**When to change:**

- Decrease (60-70%) for codebases where full mutation coverage is impractical
- Keep at 80% (industry standard) for production code

### quality.mutationTestingTiers

**Default:** `["feature", "security"]`

Risk tiers that require mutation testing. Routine tasks skip mutation testing by default.

**When to change:**

- Add `"routine"` if you want mutation testing on all tasks
- Remove tiers if mutation testing is too slow for your codebase

### quality.coverageMustNotDecrease

**Default:** true

Block tasks that decrease test coverage.

**When to change:**

- Set false during refactoring where coverage may temporarily decrease
- Keep true for feature work where coverage should increase or stay stable

---

## Task Execution

### execution.defaultModel

**Default:** sonnet | **Options:** haiku, sonnet, opus

Default model for task execution. The orchestrator overrides this on a per-task basis using the per-tier keys below — `defaultModel` is the fallback when a tier-specific key is not set.

**When to change:**

- Set to `opus` for codebases where every task benefits from heavier reasoning (rare; usually the per-tier override is the right knob).
- Set to `haiku` only if you also want to override the per-tier defaults below.

### execution.modelByTier.simple / medium / complex

Per-tier model override applied after `pipeline-classify-task` assigns a tier:

| Tier    | Default | Override key                    |
| ------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Simple  | haiku   | `execution.modelByTier.simple`  |
| Medium  | sonnet  | `execution.modelByTier.medium`  |
| Complex | opus    | `execution.modelByTier.complex` |

**When to change:**

- Bump `simple` to `sonnet` if haiku-tier tasks regularly need a fix-loop iteration; the slower model often clears the bar on the first attempt.
- Drop `complex` to `sonnet` for cost-sensitive runs on a codebase where opus offers little marginal benefit.
- Keep all three at defaults unless you have measured a tier-specific quality issue.

### execution.maxTurnsSimple / maxTurnsMedium / maxTurnsComplex

Maximum turns per task by complexity tier.

| Tier    | Default | Range  |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Simple  | 40      | 10-200 |
| Medium  | 60      | 20-200 |
| Complex | 80      | 20-200 |

**When to change:**

- Increase for tasks that require extensive exploration
- Decrease to fail fast on tasks that aren't converging

---

## Dependencies

### dependencies.prMergeTimeout

**Default:** 45 | **Range:** 5-180

Minutes to wait for a dependency PR to merge.

### dependencies.pollInterval

**Default:** 60 | **Range:** 10-300

Seconds between merge status checks.

**When to change:**

- Decrease poll interval for faster CI pipelines
- Increase timeout for repos with slow CI or required reviewers

---

## Observability

### observability.auditLog

**Default:** true

Enable tamper-evident audit logging of all tool uses.

**When to change:**

- Keep true for compliance (EU AI Act requires audit trails)
- Set false only for local experimentation

### observability.metricsExport

**Default:** json | **Options:** json, sqlite

Metrics storage format.

**When to change:**

- Use sqlite for querying metrics across many runs
- Use json for simple inspection

### observability.metricsRetentionDays

**Default:** 90 | **Range:** 7-365

Days to retain metrics data.

---

## Safety

Drives the `write-protection` and `secret-commit-guard` PreToolUse hooks. All three keys default to permissive values so the hooks no-op until a project opts in.

### safety.writeBlockedPaths

**Default:** `[]`

Glob patterns (bash globstar + extglob) of file paths that the write-protection hook must block on `Edit`/`Write`/`MultiEdit`.

**When to change:**

- Add `"**/migrations/**"` for repos where migrations must be authored by humans.
- Add `".env*"` to refuse env-file rewrites even when committing them is also blocked.
- Leave empty for repos where the in-repo CODEOWNERS / branch protection already covers the same surface.

### safety.useTruffleHog

**Default:** false

When true, the secret-commit-guard hook runs `trufflehog filesystem --directory <cwd> --only-verified` before every `git commit`, in addition to the built-in path and content-regex scans.

**When to change:**

- Enable for repos that handle production credentials; verified-only mode keeps false-positives low.
- Leave false in projects where the built-in regex sweep is sufficient (the regex set covers AWS, GitHub, OpenAI, and PEM keys).
- Enabling without `trufflehog` on PATH will log a warning and continue with regex-only scanning (does not block).

### safety.allowedSecretPatterns

**Default:** `[]`

Regex patterns (extended regex) for known-safe strings that look secret-ish but aren't, e.g. Supabase anon keys (`eyJ...` JWTs that are public by design) or Stripe publishable keys (`pk_live_...`).

**When to change:**

- Add a project's well-known public keys here once, instead of disabling the hook per-commit.
- Each entry is matched against the raw value of any path-scan hit or TruffleHog finding; a match filters that finding out before the hook decides whether to block.
