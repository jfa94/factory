# The Plugin Data Dir and the Foreign `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` Leak

All run/spec state lives OUTSIDE the target repo, under factory's canonical
plugin data dir (`~/.claude/plugins/data/factory-<marketplace-id>`); the
[configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#data-dir-claude_plugin_data) documents the
resolution rules and the redirect notice. This page explains **why** the redirect
exists and why the notice is benign.

A **successful** redirect logs at **DEBUG** (Fix 8) — it is self-correcting, so it
stays out of normal output; only a real fault inside the expected data dir (an
unparseable `marketplace.json`) still logs at WARN.

## Root cause (why it happens, why it's benign)

The leak is external to factory: Claude Code does not scope
`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` per-plugin in the **shared process env**, so a sibling
plugin that exports it (e.g. `codex`) leaves its value visible to every
`factory` subprocess. Factory's defense is two-layer and complete on its own
side:

1. **Primary pin — `merged-settings.json`.** In autonomous mode (the sanctioned
   run path), `factory autonomy ensure` bakes
   `env.CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA = <canonical dir>` into the merged settings file the
   session relaunches with (`src/cli/subcommands/autonomy.ts`), so the var is
   correct from process start and no redirect fires.
2. **Backstop — the `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` self-correct.** When a session was
   _not_ launched through merged settings (a foreign value leaked in),
   `resolveDataDir()` re-derives the canonical dir from `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`
   (the per-plugin anchor Claude Code injects reliably) and the DEBUG notice is
   simply **evidence the backstop fired** — not a factory misconfiguration.

## Why the notice repeats across commands

The once-per-process dedup cannot span processes, and every `factory` CLI call
is a fresh process, so each command re-derives and re-notifies once (at DEBUG). It
is cosmetic; correctness (state always under factory's own dir) is already
guaranteed by the two layers above. The only way to silence it permanently is
to stop the foreign export — i.e. set `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` to factory's
canonical dir in your shell profile, or launch through `merged-settings.json`
(which pins it for you).
