# Rate Limiting

This document explains how the pipeline manages API rate limits and pauses.

## Two Rate Limit Windows

Anthropic's API has two independent rate limit windows:

**5-Hour Burst Window**

- Resets every 5 hours (session-anchored, not UTC-clock)
- Designed to prevent short-term overconsumption

**7-Day Rolling Window**

- Resets on a rolling 7-day basis
- Designed for sustained usage budgeting
- Harder to recover from when exceeded

Both windows are tracked independently. Exceeding either triggers recovery behavior.

## How the Pipeline Checks Limits

Before each task spawn, the orchestrator runs:

```bash
pipeline-quota-check
```

This script reads `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/usage-cache.json`, which is written by
`bin/statusline-wrapper.sh` on every Claude Code statusline update. The statusline
JSON provides real-time `rate_limits` data — no API calls, no token cost.

Fields read from `usage-cache.json`:

- `five_hour.used_percentage`
- `five_hour.resets_at` (epoch seconds)
- `seven_day.used_percentage`
- `seven_day.resets_at` (epoch seconds)
- `captured_at` (epoch seconds of last statusline update)

The script computes dynamic thresholds based on window position:

**5-Hour Window:**

```
window_hour = 1-5 (which hour of the 5h window)
hourly_threshold = min(window_hour * 20, 90)
```

In hour 1, the threshold is 20%. By hour 5, it's 90%. This allows heavier usage late in the window when you're closer to reset.

**7-Day Window:**

```
window_day = 1-7 (which day of the 7d window)
thresholds = [14, 29, 43, 57, 71, 86, 95]
daily_threshold = thresholds[window_day - 1]
```

Similar logic: more aggressive usage is allowed later in the window.

## Model Routing Decisions

`pipeline-model-router` takes the quota check output and makes routing decisions:

**Case: Both windows within limits**

```json
{ "provider": "anthropic", "action": "proceed" }
```

Normal operation. Use Claude.

**Case: 5h over threshold, 7d within limits**

```json
{ "provider": "anthropic", "action": "wait", "wait_minutes": 47 }
```

Wait for the 5h window reset. `wait_minutes` is derived from `resets_at_epoch`
in the quota output — accurate to the actual session window, not a fixed UTC boundary.

**Case: 7d over threshold**

```json
{ "action": "end_gracefully" }
```

Stop spawning new tasks. Let in-flight tasks complete. Mark run as `partial`.

---

## Statusline Setup

`usage-cache.json` is written by `bin/statusline-wrapper.sh`. This is a
one-time user setup step:

Set `statusLine.command` in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "/path/to/dark-factory/bin/statusline-wrapper.sh"
  }
}
```

If you already have a statusline configured, set `DARK_FACTORY_ORIGINAL_STATUSLINE`
in the `env` field so the wrapper chains to it:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "DARK_FACTORY_ORIGINAL_STATUSLINE": "~/.claude/statusline.sh"
  },
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "/path/to/dark-factory/bin/statusline-wrapper.sh"
  }
}
```

The wrapper is fail-silent on the cache write — a broken jq or missing directory
never breaks statusline output.

---

## Freshness

If `captured_at` is >120s old, `pipeline-quota-check` logs a warning but still
uses the data. This can happen during long `Agent()` tool calls when Claude Code's
statusline pauses. The cached values are still the most recent available.

---

## Wall-Clock Circuit Breaker

Independent of API rate limits, the pipeline can enforce a wall-clock cap via `maxRuntimeMinutes`. When set to a positive value, `pipeline-circuit-breaker` trips if the active runtime (excluding pauses) exceeds the threshold.

**Default: `0` (disabled).** The pipeline runs until all tasks complete or `maxConsecutiveFailures` is reached.

**When to enable:**

Set a positive `maxRuntimeMinutes` as an emergency brake on unattended cost exposure:

```
/dark-factory:configure
> Set maxRuntimeMinutes to 480
```

Pause time (rate-limit waits) is excluded from the runtime counter, so a pipeline that waits for API windows will not trip the breaker prematurely.

**Resuming after a runtime trip:**

```
/dark-factory:run resume
```

The orchestrator reads persisted state and continues from the first incomplete task.

---

## Graceful Exit

When 7d limits are exceeded:

1. Stop spawning new tasks
2. Let in-flight tasks complete
3. Mark run status as `partial`
4. Update `state.json` with resume-point
5. Print summary: utilization, next threshold, expected reset

The user can resume later:

```
/dark-factory:run resume
```

---

## Monitoring Usage

Check current utilization:

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/usage-cache.json" | jq '{
  five_hour: .five_hour.used_percentage,
  seven_day: .seven_day.used_percentage,
  captured_at: .captured_at
}'
```

Check run metrics for model distribution:

```bash
cat "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs/current/state.json" | jq '.cost.by_model'
```
