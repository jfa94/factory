# Dark Factory Plugin — PRD: Problem, Goals & Feature List

## Problem Statement

The [dark-factory](https://github.com/jfa94/dark-factory) autonomous coding pipeline (~3,700 lines, 17 Bash modules) converts GitHub PRD issues into merged pull requests with minimal human intervention. It works, but suffers from fundamental limitations inherent to a shell-based architecture:

**Shell fragility** — Bash lacks structured error handling, type safety, and composability. State management is ad-hoc (JSON files manipulated with `jq`), parallelism is limited to background processes with PID tracking, and recovery from partial failures requires manual intervention.

**No native Claude Code integration** — the pipeline invokes Claude Code as an external subprocess, losing access to the agent framework's native capabilities: worktree isolation, background agent execution, subagent spawning, skill injection, hook-based safety enforcement, and MCP server integration.

**Limited quality assurance** — the current pipeline has a single code review pass. Research evidence shows this is insufficient:

- AI-generated tests achieve 85-95% line coverage but only 30-40% mutation scores (tautological tests that assert what was written, not what should work)
- Veracode: AI code has 2.74x more vulnerabilities than human-written code
- LinearB: 67.3% of AI-generated PRs rejected vs 15.6% for human code
- DORA 2025: 90% AI adoption correlates with 154% PR size increase, 91% more review time, 9% bug rate climb

**No adversarial review** — the pipeline uses a single reviewer pass. Actor-Critic adversarial review (3-5 rounds) eliminates 90%+ issues at ~$0.20-$1.00/feature vs $50-$100/hr human review (Autonoma: 73% more issues caught, 71% fewer bugs, 42% less review time).

**No rate limit resilience** — when Anthropic API rate limits are reached, the pipeline stalls entirely. Local LLM fallback via Ollama could keep routine tasks progressing.

**Opportunity:** Claude Code's plugin system provides native primitives (agents, hooks, bin scripts, skills, commands, MCP servers) that map directly to pipeline concerns. A plugin re-implementation gains worktree isolation, background execution, un-bypassable hooks, skill injection, and persistent state — while maintaining the deterministic-first architecture that makes the Bash pipeline reliable.

## Goals

1. **Minimal-intervention PRD execution** — convert a PRD issue to merged PRs with a single command. Human touchpoints are explicit and by design:

   **One-time setup (per project):**
   - Install the plugin from the marketplace
   - Run `/dark-factory:configure` to set project-specific thresholds (quota.pause_threshold, parallel.max_concurrent, review.spec_threshold)
   - Create a GitHub label `prd` for PRD issues (or use file-based PRDs)

   **Per run:**
   - Create a GitHub issue labeled `prd` describing the work
   - Run `/dark-factory:run <issue_number>` (or omit the number to use the most-recently-updated prd-labeled issue)

   **During the run (intervention points):**
   - Tasks escalated to `needs_human_review` require human approval — these happen when:
     - Quality gates fail 3 times in a row on the same task
     - Code review verdicts return REQUEST_CHANGES 3 times in a row
     - Circuit breaker trips (runtime, cost, or failure caps exceeded)
     - A reviewer returns NEEDS_DISCUSSION
   - PRs that pass all automated checks merge without human action unless the project's GitHub branch protection rules require a human approver

   **Not autonomous by design:**
   - Merging PRs into `main` — the plugin merges into `staging`. A human (or separate release automation) promotes `staging` → `main`
   - Deleting branches on `main` or `master` — blocked by hooks
   - Modifying `.env*`, migrations, secrets — blocked by hooks

   Goal #1 is satisfied when a labeled PRD issue can be completed by running a single command and approving escalated tasks along the way.

2. **Deterministic-first architecture** — ~3:1 ratio of deterministic components (bin scripts, hooks) to non-deterministic (agents). Agent instructions are followed ~70%; hooks/scripts enforce at 100%. Concrete operational rules outperform abstract directives by 123%.
3. **Quality-first additions** from research:
   - 5-layer quality gate stack (static analysis → tests → coverage regression → holdout validation → mutation testing)
   - Adversarial code review (Actor-Critic, multi-round, Codex-first with Claude Code fallback)
   - Risk-based task classification (routine/feature/security → tiered review intensity)
   - Holdout validation (StrongDM Attractor pattern)
4. **Local LLM fallback** via Ollama when Anthropic rate limits are approached — keep routine tasks progressing instead of stalling
5. **Reuse existing `.claude/` setup** — spawn the user's spec-reviewer, code-reviewer, and scout agents directly. Bundle architecture-reviewer, security-reviewer, test-writer, and scribe inside the plugin. Leverage existing hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, dangerous-patterns, etc.) that fire automatically.
6. **Observability and compliance** — tamper-evident audit logs, delegation chains, metrics (EU AI Act Aug 2026 readiness)
7. **Resume capability** — pipeline recovers from interruptions by reading persisted state

---

## Non-Goals

- **Not a general-purpose CI/CD system** — this is specifically an autonomous coding pipeline for converting PRD issues to merged PRs
- **Not replacing human architectural decisions** — the pipeline implements tasks from human-authored PRDs; it does not decide what to build
- **Not supporting non-GitHub platforms** — GitHub issues and PRs are the only supported input/output initially
- **Not a real-time system** — pipeline runs are batch operations; there is no streaming or event-driven architecture requirement

## User Personas

### Solo Developer (primary)

Runs the pipeline autonomously on personal projects. Wants to convert a PRD issue into a merged PR overnight. Values: speed, minimal supervision, cost efficiency. Uses local LLM fallback to stay within API budget.

### Team Lead

Configures the pipeline for team repositories. Sets human review levels (e.g., Level 1: PR approval required). Wants observability into what the pipeline did and why. Values: audit trails, configurable quality gates, team-safe defaults.

### Security-Conscious Developer

Works on repositories with auth, payment, or PII handling. Needs security-tier review (5 adversarial rounds + security-reviewer + architecture-reviewer). Wants tamper-evident logs for compliance. Values: defense in depth, zero silent failures.

## Autonomy Spectrum

The plugin supports operating modes from least to most autonomous. Controlled by `userConfig.humanReviewLevel`:

### Level 4: Full Supervision

Human approves at every stage: spec, task decomposition, each task execution, each review round, PR creation.
**Use case:** First run on a new codebase, learning the pipeline's behavior.

### Level 3: Spec Approval

Pipeline pauses after spec generation for human review. Once approved, executes autonomously through PR creation.
**Use case:** Team repos where architecture decisions need human sign-off.

### Level 2: Review Checkpoint

Pipeline runs through spec + execution autonomously. Pauses after adversarial code review for human sign-off before PR.
**Use case:** Solo dev who trusts spec generation but wants to review code.

### Level 1: PR Approval (default)

Pipeline runs end-to-end autonomously, creates PR. Human reviews and merges.
**Use case:** Standard autonomous workflow — overnight PR generation.

### Level 0: Full Autonomy

Pipeline creates PR, enables auto-merge. Human reviews merged code post-hoc.
**Use case:** Low-risk routine tasks, trusted codebase with strong test coverage.

### Single-Task Mode

Execute one task from an existing spec. Useful for retrying a failed task or running a specific task manually.
**Invocation:** `/dark-factory:run --task <task_id> --spec <spec-dir>`

### Spec-to-PR Mode

Generate spec from PRD → execute all tasks → create single PR. No issue discovery or multi-PRD batching.
**Invocation:** `/dark-factory:run --prd <issue-number>`

### Full Dark Factory Mode

Discover `[PRD]`-tagged issues → generate specs → execute → review → merge → close issues. The original autonomous pipeline.
**Invocation:** `/dark-factory:run --discover`
